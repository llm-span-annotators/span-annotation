at least they were reporting on both sides as a whole.\nNow, it\u2019s quite different.\nDonald Trump is extremely vilified not because he allegedly is/was racist/sexist, but because he threatens

I. Hayakawa, to advance understanding of a supply-side economic policy cure to the stagflation that threatened the US budget\u2019s ability to meet its obligations.\nRepublican Senators Hatch, Roth, and Hayakawa were trying to introduce a supply-side economic policy as a cure for the stagflation that was threatening the US economy with failure.\nThe Democrats, who later in the Senate led the way to a supply-side policy, were, at this time, opposed (see Paul Craig Roberts, The Supply-Side Revolution, Harvard University Press, 1984).\nThe Democrats claimed that the policy would worsen the budget deficit, the only time in those days Democrats cared about the budget deficit.\nThe Democrats said that they would support the tax rate reductions if the Republicans would support offsetting cuts in the budget to support a balanced budget.\nThis was a ploy to put Republicans on the spot for taking away some groups\u2019 handouts in order \u201cto cut tax rates for the rich.\u201d\nThe supply-side policy did not require budget cuts, but in order to demonstrate the Democrats lack of sincerety, Hayakawa\u2019s aid and I had our senators introduce a series of budget cuts together with tax cuts that, on a static revenue basis (not counting tax revenue feedbacks from the incentives of the lower tax rates) kept the budget even, and the Democrats voted against them every time.\nWhen the combination of tax cuts with defense budget cuts came up for a vote, the legendary senator Strom Thurmond, a 48-year member of the US Senate from South Carolina, tapped me on the shoulder.\nHe said: \u201cson, never set your senator up against the military/security complex.\nHe will not be re-elected, and you will be out of a job.\u201d I replied that we were just establishing for the record that under no conditions would the Democrats, who wanted more government, vote for a tax rate reduction even if there was a case that it would cure stagflation.\nHe replied: \u201cson, the military/security complex doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\nMy emergence from The Matrix began with Thurmond\u2019s pat on my shoulder.\nIt grew with my time at the Wall Street Journal when I learned that some truthful things simply could not be said.\nIn the Treasury I experienced how those outside interests opposed to a president\u2019s policy marshall their forces and the media that they own to block it.\nLater as a member of a secret presidential committee, I saw how the CIA attempted to prevent President Reagan from ending the Cold War.\nToday, right now, at this moment, we are faced with a massive effort of the military/security complex, the neoconservatives, the Democratic Party, and the presstitute media to discredit the elected President of the United States and to overthrow him in order that the utterly corrupt elite that rule American can continue to hold on to power and to protect the massive budget of the military/security complex that, along with the Israel Lobby, funds the elections of those who rule us.\nTrump, like Reagan, was an exception, and it is the exceptions that accumulate the ire of the corrupt leftwing, bought off with money, and the ire of the media, concentrated into small tight ownership groups indebted to those who permitted the illegal concentration of a once independent and diverse American media that once served, on occasion, as a watchdog over government.\nThe rightwing, wrapped in the flag, dismisses all truth as \u201canti-American.\u201d\nIf Putin, Lavrov, the Russian government, the traitorous Russian Fifth Column\u2014the Atlanticist Integrationists\u2014the Chinese, the Iranians, the North Koreans think that any peace or consideration can come out of America, they are insane.\nTheir delusions are setting themselves up for destruction.\nThere is no institution in America, government or private, that can be trusted.\nAny government or person who trusts America or any Western country is stupid beyond belief.\nThe entire Russiagate hoax is an orchestration by the military/security complex, led by John Brennen, Comey, and Rosenstein.\nThe purpose is to discredit President trump for two reasons.\nOne is to prevent any normalization of relations with Russia.\nThe other is to remove Trump\u2019s agenda as an alternative to the agenda of the Democratic Party.\nHow America Was Lost: ...

Bush and Obama, will be set against them.\nThe rebellions will be local and suppressed by every violation of the US Constitution by the private powers that rule Washington, as always has been the case with rebellions in America.\nIn the West, which the Russians are so anxious to join, all freedoms are dead\u2014freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom of association, freedom of inquiry, freedom of privacy, freedom from arbitrary search, freedom from arbitrary arrest, along with the Constitutional protections of due process and habeas corpus.\nToday there are no countries less free than the United States of America.\nWhy do the Russian Atlanticist Integrationists want to join an unfree Western world?\nAre they that brainwashed by Western Propaganda?\nIf Putin listens to these deluded fools, Putin will destroy Russia.\nThere is something wrong with Russian perception of Washington.\nApparently the Russian elite, with the exception of Shoigu and a few others are incapable of comprehending the neoconservative drive for US world hegemony and the neoconservative determination to destroy Russia as a constraint on US unilateralism.\nThe Russian government somehow, despite all evidence to the contrary, believes that Washington\u2019s hegemony is negotiable.\nThe Best of Paul Craig Roberts"}

Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nWhat makes this recent purge from Facebook and Twitter so egregious is that the pages like the Free Thought Project, the Anti-Media, Press for Truth, and dozens of others, did not fit the hate speech narrative these same companies used to wipe out Alex Jones.\nInstead, these pages were dedicated to spreading peace, bridging the divide, bringing humanity together and holding government accountable.\nAnd how does this poem end, again?\nhttps://t.co/nUZ82x9JFt \u2014 Anya Parampil (@anyaparampil) August 6, 2018\nThe purge happened around 12:30 p.m. CST with mainstream news reports launching at the same time \u2014 implying that they were given the heads up about the move.\nIn a statement co-authored by Facebook Head of Cybersecurity Nathaniel Gleicher \u2014 who Caitlin Johnstone aptly points out, also happens to be the former White House National Security Council Director of Cybersecurity Policy \u2014 the massive social media platform explained that it has removed \u201c559 Pages and 251 accounts that have consistently broken our rules against spam and coordinated inauthentic behavior.\u201d\nFacebook said the pages were \u201cworking to mislead others about who they are, and what they are doing.\u201d However, this couldn\u2019t be further from the truth.\nOur names, addresses, and phone numbers were on all of our pages and our profiles.\n\u201cWe were verified by Facebook with a little check mark next to our name, so they know we are a legitimate organization/outlet.\nThey have seen our \u201cArticles of Organization\u201d which was issued by the state of Louisiana, which is where my partner and The Free Thought Project co-founder lives,\u201d Jason Bassler, co-founder of the Free Thought Project explained.\nHowever, in their statement, Facebook then suggested the real reason behind the purge \u2014 elections are coming \u2014 and pesky folks like the independent media have a way of reporting information on candidates that the mainstream tends to ignore \u2014 like war, corruption, and most recently, Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s disdain for the Constitution.\n\u201cGiven the activity we\u2019ve seen \u2014 and its timing ahead of the US midterm elections \u2014 we wanted to give some details about the types of behavior that led to this action,\u201d Facebook said, before accusing us of hawking fake products or functioning as ad farms that tricked \u201cpeople into thinking that they were forums for legitimate political debate.\u201d\nIt should be stated that TFTP never hid the fact that we worked with other independent media groups to share our information around the web \u2014 this is the very definition of grassroots.\nBut all of us together certainly posed a threat to the mainstream so this nonsense about tricking people was brought into play.\nWithin all of our pages under the Free Thought umbrella, we had close to 6 million followers.\nDoes Facebook think it knows better than the 6 million people who clicked like on our page?\nWe also had close to 16,000 reviews on our page with an average 4.1 star rating, directly showing that people desired to see what we were putting out.\nThe only ones manipulating people here are the tech giants themselves.\nAll but proving the case that this was a coordinated attack by the tech giant community, shortly after the purge on Facebook, Twitter followed suit, wiping out our profiles on there as well.\nThey gave absolutely no reason for the suspension.\n\u201cThis signifies a re-consolidation of the media.\nCable news media controlled the narrative for most of modern history, but the internet has lowered that barrier to entry and allowed the average person to become the media themselves.\nThis obviously took market share and influence away from the traditional media, and it has allowed for a more diverse public conversation.\nNow it seems the platforms that have monopolized the industry are favoring mainstream sources and silencing alternative voices.\nSo now, instead of allowing more people to have a voice, these platforms are creating an atmosphere where only powerful media organizations are welcome, just as we had on cable news,\u201d John Vibes poignantly noted.\nThe bottom line is that sites like ours and the others who were wiped from the internet yesterday represent a voice against the plutocratic information-controlling establishment.\nWe challenge their paradigm of control and this is a thorn in their side.\nThere are no longer distinct lines between social media giants and government either which renders the \u201cthey are private, they can do what they wish\u201d argument moot.\nFacebook has been partnering with the Digital Forensics Lab, an arm of the Atlantic Council think tank \u2014 a neoconservative group funded by Gulf monarchies, defense giants like Raytheon, megabanks like HSBC, foreign state actors, and the US government \u2014 to weed out people like us who challenge the status quo.\nThe entity that is making censorship decisions for Facebook, as publicly announced, is the Atlantic Council, a partly US government-funded entity.\nAt what point will the extremely tight ties between these companies and the US government end the \"they are private\" argument?\n\u2014 Daniel McAdams (@DanielLMcAdams) October 12, 2018\nServing as a kick in the teeth to the thousands of people who lost their livelihoods yesterday because of this purge is the fact that pages who do set out to deliberately deceive people, put out actual fake news, and slander others \u2014 like the infamous Your News Wire \u2014 remain intact and able to post.\nNo, we are not calling for these fake pages to be removed, but instead using it as a point of reference as to why they targeted us when pages like YNW have become famous for spreading lies and deceiving people.\nThose who demanded Facebook & other Silicon Valley giants censor political content - something they didn't actually want to do - are finding that content that they themselves support & like end up being repressed.\nThat's what has happened to every censorship advocate in history: https://t.co/IZHF8GVkgC \u2014 Glenn Greenwald (@ggreenwald) October 12, 2018\nIndeed, we have reached the precipice of corporate-state censorship.\nThose who have constantly demanded that tech giants silence their critics and information that \u2018offends\u2019 them are finally seeing the inevitable results of such irresponsible acts.\nAs we have been pointing out for the last two years, tech monopolies large enough to silence those with whom you disagree, are large enough to one day silence you.\nThe silver lining to this massive purge of independent media is that it signals the beginning of the end of censored media.\nTFTP has been planning for this day and we have been growing our email list and our subscriber base.\nWe will not be silenced.\nWhile it may seem bleak for now, we will rise from the ashes of the social media dinosaurs to help build and create new platforms that are out of their control where ideas of peace and freedom can be discussed openly without fear of devoting years to a platform that can disappear you in the blink of an eye.\nIf you are not on our email list, please sign up here.\nIf you\u2019d like to subscribe to our site to aid in the battle against the censors and receive

allowing a Texas-based company, Defense Distributed, to resume online-sharing of blueprints for the 3D firearms.\nThe company was set to allow downloads on Wednesday, although blueprints have been posted since Friday.\nThe temporary restraining order blocks the release until the next scheduled hearing on August 10.\nIn the meantime, Congressional Democrats have urged President Trump to reverse the decision letting Defense Distributed publish the plans.\nTrump said Tuesday that he's \"looking into\" the idea, saying making 3D plastic guns available to the public \"doesn't seem to make much sense!\"\nDoesn't make much sense?\nAre you people serious?\nWhy, yes, yes they are serious.\nDeadly serious.\nIt makes perfect sense when you have the same people who have absolutely no problem with mothers hiring hitmen to murder their babies in their wombs in the most brutal and barbaric fashion, and then sell off their body parts for profit, if they don't throw them in the trash or flush them down a toilet, calling for computer files to be kept by the government and not be allowed to be released to the public.\nThe eight states are the usual suspects, along with the District of Columbia, and we should note which ones they are.\nWashington\nConnecticut\nMaryland\nNew Jersey\nNew York\nOregon\nMassachusetts\nPennsylvania\nWashington's Attorney General Bob Ferguson's office claims the settlement is:\n...in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act....there is no indication in the settlement agreement or elsewhere that any analysis, study or determination was made by the government defendants in consultation with other agencies, before the federal government agreed to lift export controls on the downloadable guns.\nIn fact, the agreement states that it \"does not reflect any agreed-upon purpose other than the desire of the Parties to reach a full and final conclusion of the Action, and to resolve the Action without the time and expense of further litigation.\"\nThe lawsuit also argues the settlement violates the Tenth Amendment by infringing on states' rights to regulate firearms.\nWashington has a robust regulatory system meant to keep firearms out of the hands of dangerous individuals.\nThat system is jeopardized by the Trump Administration's action and will be undermined by the distribution of Defense Distributed's downloadable guns.\nNote that Ferguson forgets that the Tenth Amendment states plainly:\nThe powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\n(emphasis mine)\nSince our founders clearly said that our rights come from our Creator, and the Second Amendment acknowledges that the \"right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed,\" I truly wonder where he gets this idea the state has a right to do just that, infringe on the rights of the people by regulating firearms.\nhe is reading something into it that is simply not there, but that's a Communist ideology you are seeing there, not an American one.\nReason reports on the response of Defense Distributed:\nJosh Blackman, one of Defense Distributed's lawyers, said in an email today that \"The District Court in Washington already approved the settlement.\nThis latest suit is another collateral attack on a rule-making process that began in the Obama Administration.\"\nAs reported yesterday, Defense Distributed is already embroiled in its own lawsuit against New Jersey and Los Angeles over those authorities' threats, and simultaneously is fighting Pennsylvania's request for a temporary restraining order against them.\n(Both those states are also part of today's federal lawsuit filed in the Western District of Washington.)\nWhile the various court filings about this continue to suggest that August 1 is the date on which Defense Distributed will begin distributing the files\u2014which, again, the settlement legally permits them to do\u2014the distribution is already happening.\nCody Wilson of Defense Distributed is already fundraising off the suit via Twitter.\nHe told me five years ago, when I was writing a feature story on the beginnings of his fight with the government over gun-making files, that \"This has been a continuous process of different levels of authority figures trying to stop it from happening and thus allowing it to happen...Of course we are going to succeed\u2014because you all are trying to stop me.\nThat seemed natural and ended up being true.\"\nSo far, that has continued to be true.\nThis federal judge should know what the Constitution actually says and should have tossed this frivolous lawsuit in the trash where it belongs.\nInstead, he is demonstrating he is not even fit to sit on the bench, and the attorney generals of each of these states are demonstrating they are not fit to be in the office they are in.\nSpeaking of Defense Distributed and Cody Wilson, enter to win this Ghost Gunner 2 and make your own guns at home!"}

it is clear that the missiles in question had been in the possession of Yemen well before the Saudi Arabian-led intervention of 2015, and that their source was either Soviet or North Korean.\nThe modification kits, on the other hand, appear to be of Iranian origin, and were transported to Yemen via Oman.\nThe UN panel claims not to have any evidence of \u2018external missile specialists\u2019 working alongside the Houthi; indeed, the simplicity of the Burkhan 2-H modification concept is such that anyone already familiar with the SCUD-B missile system would be able to implement the required processes without outside assistance.\u201d [emphasis added]\nSo where did the missiles come from, and who made them?\nAccording to Ritter:\n\u201cRather than the Iranian-manufactured Qiam-1 missiles Haley and the Saudi Arabian government claimed, the debris presented by Haley were of a modified Soviet-manufactured SCUD-B missile; the airframe and engine are original Soviet-made components, and many of the smaller parts on display bear Cyrillic (i.e., Russian) markings.\nThe transformation to the Burkhan 2-H design required the Houthi engineers to increase the size of the fuel and oxidizer tanks, and lengthen the airframe accordingly.\nThis is done by cutting the airframe, and welding in place the appropriate segments (this also required that the fuel supply pipe, which passes through the oxidizer tank, be similarly lengthened.)\nThe difference in quality between the factory welds and the new welds is readily discernable.\nThe increased fuel supply permits a longer engine burn, which in turn increases the range of the missile.\nThe Burkhan 2-H uses a smaller warhead than the SCUD B; as such, the guidance and control section had been reconfigured to a smaller diameter, and an inter-stage section added to connect the warhead/guidance section with the main airframe.\u201d\n\ufeff\nThose who have been paying attention to this conflict have been well aware that the U.S. has had little material evidence to link Yemen\u2019s Houthis to Iranian arms suppliers.\nIn January of this year, a panel of U.N. experts stated:\n\u201cThe panel has not seen sufficient evidence to confirm any direct large-scale supply of arms from the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, although there are indicators that anti-tank guided weapons being supplied to the Houthi or Saleh forces are of Iranian manufacture.\u201d [emphasis added]\nEven if Iran were arming the Houthis, Haley\u2019s hypocritical anti-Iran rhetoric doesn\u2019t excuse the U.S. for continuing a foreign policy that essentially armed ISIS through U.S. weapons transfers, or for arming al-Qaeda\u2019s affiliate in Syria, just to name two examples of Washington\u2019s schizophrenic approach to the region.\nWhy is the U.S. singling out Iran, especially when the Houthi rebels are sworn enemies of al-Qaeda?\nThe issues here go much deeper than nonsensical hypocrisy.\nAccording to Ritter, the entire debacle has shown that if Saudi Arabia cannot contain the Houthi\u2019s missile capabilities, it cannot possibly hope to take on Iran, which possesses a significantly more advanced military than the Houthis do on their own.\nRitter explains further:\n\u201cIf a relatively unsophisticated foe such as the Houthi, using Iranian-modified Soviet and North Korean missiles derived from 40-year-old technology, can evade an enemy force using the most modern combat aircraft backed up by the most sophisticated intelligence gathering systems available, and successfully launch ballistic missiles that threaten the political and economic infrastructure of the targeted state, what does that say about the prospects of any U.S.-led coalition taking on the far more advanced mobile missile threats that exist in North Korea and Iran today?\nThe fact of the matter is that no military anywhere has shown the ability to successfully interdict in any meaningful way a determined opponent armed with mobile ballistic missile capability.\nIf the Saudi experience in Yemen is to teach us anything, it is that any military plan designed to confront nations such as North Korea, Iran and Russia that are armed with sophisticated mobile ballistic missiles had better count on those capabilities remaining intact throughout any anticipated period of hostility.\nNo amount of chest-thumping and empty rhetoric by American political and/or military leaders can offset this harsh reality.\nThis is the critical lesson of Yemen, and the United States would do well to heed it before it tries to foment a crisis based upon trumped-up charges.\u201d [emphasis added]"}

to search New Mexico compound\n\n(CNN) A New Mexico couple told authorities months ago they thought a missing Georgia boy and his fugitive father were living in a filthy compound on their property.\nBut police did not carry out a search of the property until last week, Taos County Sheriff Jerry Hogrefe said, because they did not believe they had probable cause in the case.\nThat delay is facing scrutiny in the wake of Monday's discovery of a young boy's remains at the compound.\n\"They were dragging their feet.\nThey were taking too long,\" said Tanya Badger, who with her husband, Jason, told authorities about the boy's suspected presence at the compound.\n\"Even if they were trying to build a case or whatnot, a child's life is at stake.\"\nIt's not clear whether the remains are those of Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj, a child with severe medical problems who disappeared from Georgia about nine months ago.\nThe remains were discovered in a wretched compound along with 11 starving children, authorities said.\nMore details about the horrid compound could be revealed Wednesday when the five adults arrested from the site make their first court appearances.\nAuthorities raided the compound in Amalia, New Mexico, on Friday as part of their search for Abdul-Ghani, whose father, Siraj Wahhaj, allegedly abducted him from Georgia in November.\nNeighbors raised alarm about a suspect\nThe Badgers , whose land the compound was on, said they saw a boy they thought was Abdul-Ghani in January and February.\nIn April, they discovered the boy was listed as missing and his father a fugitive.\nThey reported the sightings to state and local law enforcement, but it was months before police moved in, the couple said.\n\"We are just beyond frustrated that they took so long,\" Tanya Badger said.\nNew Mexico authorities had suspected the father and son might be at the compound after learning about the abduction in May, the sheriff said.\nBut there was not enough evidence for a search warrant, and surveillance of the property didn't identify the pair there.\n\"I had no probable cause to go onto this property,\" Hogrefe said.\n\"In hindsight I wish there was, but we would not have been there lawfully.\"\nThe sheriff said that \"they did surveillance, both ground and aerial, and photographs were shared with the family and mother of the missing boy.\nThe boy Abdul was never identified from those photos.\nMoving forward we knew that there was this compound, but we had very little details about it or who was occupying it.\nThese people just kind of (sprang) up very quickly.\"\nThe authorities' view changed Thursday when they said they received a message about possible starving children living on the compound, and had enough probable cause to put in an affidavit for a search warrant.\n\"We are starving and need food and water,\" the message said, according to authorities.\nAuthorities said it was forwarded to them but did not provide details on its origin.\nCompound wasn't searched thoroughly, couple say\nWhen officers executed a search warrant on the compound, they found a horrifying scene.\nStacks of tires, piles of trash and plastic sheets surrounded the compound.\nObscured by the junk was a trailer where the 11 children and five adults were living.\nThe children wore dirty rags for clothing with no shoes, and were surrounded by weapons and rounds of ammunition, authorities said.\n\"It was the saddest living conditions and poverty I have seen,\" Hogrefe said.\nThe father of the missing boy, Siraj Wahhaj, was arrested at the compound Friday along with his sisters Hujrah Wahhaj and Subhannah Wahhaj and two other adults -- Lucas Morten and Jany Leveille.\nAll have been charged with abuse of the 11 children.\nMorten was charged with harboring a fugitive.\nHowever, the Badgers said that police did not do a thorough job searching the property.\nThe couple said they went back over the weekend after they found out Abdul-Ghani wasn't among the 11 children discovered during the raid.\nTanya and Jason Badger said they told authorities they had seen a boy they thought was Abdul-Ghani Wahhaj.\nThey said they were surprised to see the scene was not taped off and was still largely untouched.\nThey found two guns, ammo, tactical vests and video cameras that police initially missed, Jason Badger said.\n\"When we first went up there, nothing was overturned,\" he said.\n\"You could tell nobody had looked underneath that, nobody had looked underneath this.\"\nFather allegedly took boy in November\nAbdul-Ghani's mother, Hakima Ramzi, could not be reached after authorities announced the discovery of the remains.\nBut hours earlier, Ramzi told CNN she had no idea he'd disappear with their son for nine months, only to be found across the country with 11 other children\n\"My husband said he was taking Abdul-Ghani to the park, and didn't come back.\nThat was in November 2017.\nWhen I would ask him where he was, he said he was on his way, he was coming soon, he was just keeping him for the night.\nBut I haven't seen him since then,\" Ramzi said Tuesday.\nShe said her son cannot walk and suffers seizures, and requires constant medical attention.\nAn arrest warrant states that Wahhaj \"wanted to perform an exorcism\" on the child because he believed he was possessed by the devil.\nBut Ramzi said her husband was planning to perform a ruqya -- an Islamic practice involving prayer that is believed to help rid a body of illness.\n\"It's not an exorcism.\nThat was a translation issue in the court,\" Ramzi said.\nHe \"just wanted to pray for Abdul-Ghani to get better.\"\nPolice stopped the father in Alabama\nIn December, days after Ramzi reported her son missing, the child's father was involved in an accident in Alabama, according to a police report.\nThe SUV had seven children -- but none of them was listed with Abdul-Ghani's date of birth.\nSiraj Wahhaj is accused of fleeing Georgia with his young son.\nBut at the time, the group told Alabama police they were headed to New Mexico for camping, and continued on their way.\nEven though the boy was reported missing, there was no child abduction warrant against Wahhaj because he was married to his son's mother, and they both had equal custody, Clayton County police said.\nThe SUV was registered to Leveille, who was also in the vehicle.\nShe would later become one of the five adults arrested at the compound in New Mexico.\nThe children were taken into protective custody and later turned over to the New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department."}

of court, he was imprisoned more for who he is and what he says rather than what he is supposed to have done.,\" he added.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not necessary to agree with everything he says, it\u2019s

about the monstrous crimes committed in the name of Islam all over this country every day?\nWhy?\u201d Waters asked.\nWell, the questions are obviously rhetorical.\nWe know why.\nThe UK is frightened

open to union members and guests.\nPrior to the event, Ellison's campaign called police to ensure that he was \"protected\" from a woman armed with a mic and camera phone .\nLoomer peppered him with questions about the alleged abuse at a State Attorney General debate Friday night.\nShe stood alongside other female survivors of abuse.\nEllison not only claimed the women were lying but then fled the scene.\nAt least he said something there, which is more than I can say for his response earlier in September when Loomer confronted him at another event with questions.\nFailing to answer, Ellison tried to move from person to person, allowing his minions to try and provide cover for him, similar to that of Maxine Waters, but there was no \"member's only\" elevator to flee into.\nFinally, Ellison fled the scene, hounding by Loomer and others questioning him about the abuse.\nThe irony is of Ellison's campaign calling on the police to protect him from a woman, armed with a mic and camera phone, who is simply asking him to respond to the accusations and police report, as well as how he plans on being attorney general without a license, when he has shown his support for those that murder police officers in cold blood.\nScott Johnson reports on Ellison's sordid history supporting such criminals.\nEllison was an active supporter and local leader of the Nation of Islam in Minneapolis before his election to Congress.\n(I set forth this history in some detail in the October 9, 2006 issue of The Weekly Standard.)\nEllison has baldly dissembled about this history since 2006.\nIn his 2014 memoir My Country, \u2019Tis of Thee ,for example, Ellison simply omitted it and presented himself as a critic of Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam.\nThis past June, Ellison told Jake Tapper on CNN, \u201cI worked on the Million Man March and I was proud to do so.\nThat\u2019s it.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t it.\nEllison first sought office as a Democrat in 1998 as Keith Ellison-Muhammad, a self-avowed member of the Nation of Islam.\n(Ellison-Muhammad is just one of three Nation of Islam names Ellison has used over the years.)\nFortunately for him, Ellison\u2019s 5th District constituents haven\u2019t much cared about his history and the Minneapolis Star Tribune has almost entirely let it rest exactly where Ellison wants it.\nBut seeking the top law enforcement job in Minnesota and running for statewide office should be a more daunting challenge because Ellison is an extraordinarily poor fit for the job.\nAmong the troubling threads that run through Ellison\u2019s career: support for cop killers.\nIn September 1992 Minneapolis police officer Jerry Haaf was murdered execution-style, shot in the back as he took a coffee break at a restaurant in south Minneapolis.\nPolice later determined that Haaf\u2019s murder was a gang hit performed by four members of the city\u2019s Vice Lords gang.The leader of the Vice Lords was Sharif Willis, a convicted murderer who had been released from prison and who sought respectability as a responsible gang leader from gullible municipal authorities while operating a gang front called United for Peace.\nThe four Vice Lords members who murdered Haaf met and planned the murder at Willis\u2019s house.\nDespite the fact that two witnesses implicated Willis in the planning he was never charged because law enforcement authorities said they lacked sufficient evidence to convict him.\nAt the time, Ellison was a Minneapolis attorney in private practice.\nAnd within a month of Haaf\u2019s murder, Ellison appeared with Willis supporting the United for Peace gang front.\nIn October 1992, Ellison helped organize a demonstration against Minneapolis police that included United for Peace.\n\u201cThe main point of our rally is to support United for Peace [in its fight against] the campaign of slander the police federation has been waging,\u201d said Ellison.\nWillis was the last speaker at the demonstration.\nAccording to a contemporaneous report in the St. Paul Pioneer Press, Willis told the crowd that Minneapolis police were experiencing the same fear from young black men that blacks had felt from police for many years.\n\u201cIf the police have some fear, I understand that fear,\u201d Willis said.\n\u201cWe seem to have an overabundance of bad police.\n.\n.\n.\n[W]e\u2019re going to get rid of them,\u201d Willis said.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve got to go.\u201d The Pioneer Press account concludes with Ellison\u2019s contribution to the demonstration: \u201cEllison told the crowd that the police union is systematically frightening whites in order to get more police officers hired.\nThat way, Ellison said, the union can increase its power base.\u201d Ellison publicly supported the Haaf murder defendants.\nIn February 1993, he spoke at a demonstration for one of them during his trial.\nEllison led the crowd assembled at the courthouse in a chant that was ominous in the context of Haaf\u2019s cold-blooded murder: \u201cWe don\u2019t get no justice, you don\u2019t get no peace.\u201d Ellison\u2019s working relationship with Sharif Willis finally came to an end in February 1995, when Willis was convicted in federal court on several counts of drug and gun-related crimes and sent back to prison for 20 years.\nThe Haaf case wasn\u2019t an aberration for Ellison.\nIn February 2000, he spoke at a fundraiser sponsored by the Minnesota chapter of the old National Lawyers Guild, on whose steering committee he had served\u2014the chapter was raising funds for former Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Soliah, who had been a fugitive from justice for 25 years, on charges related to the attempted pipe bombing of Los Angeles police officers in 1975.\n(The National Lawyers Guild is an old Communist front group that somehow survived the fall of the Soviet Union.\nRegimes come and go; dupes are forever.)\nIn his National Lawyers Guild speech Ellison spoke favorably of cop killers Mumia Abu-Jamal and \u201cAssata Shakur\u201d (Joanne Chesimard), who was wanted for the murder of New Jersey state trooper Werner Foerster in 1973.\nChesimard was convicted of that murder but escaped from prison in 1979 and has been on the lam in Cuba since 1984.\nBryan Burrough\u2019s Days of Rage has a riveting account of Chesimard\u2019s terrorist career.\nIn 2013, the FBI made Chesimard the first woman named to its Most Wanted Terrorists List.\nThe FBI has offered a reward of up to $1,000,000 for her capture.\nYet Ellison prayed for Chesimard in his National Lawyers Guild speech: \u201cI am praying that Castro does not get to the point where he has to really barter with these guys over here because they\u2019re going to get Assata Shakur, they\u2019re going to get a whole lot of other people,\u201d he told the crowd.\n\u201cI hope the Cuba[n] people can stick to it, because the freedom of some good decent people depends on it.\u201d Ellison\u2019s support for Soliah/Olson in the speech is equally notable.\nHe denounced law enforcement authorities for prosecuting the attempted murder of police officers.\nReferring to the days Soliah/Olson had spent in the SLA under the leadership of Donald DeFreeze (\u201cField Marshal Cinque\u201d), Ellison hailed Soliah/Olson as a \u201cblack gang member\u201d and portrayed her as a victim of government persecution.\nHe described her as one of those who had been \u201cfighting for freedom in the \u201860s and\u201970s\u201d and called for her release.\nEllison to the contrary notwithstanding, Soliah/Olson pleaded guilty to the crimes charged in Los Angeles and to an additional murder charge in Sacramento.\nAccording to Ellison, Soliah/Olson was a social justice warrior fighting the good fight.\nThe case had nothing to do with the attempted murder of police officers; that was but a pretext.\nSeems he is more than willing to use the police to shield him from the press who will confront him publicly while taking the side of their murderers for political gain.\nShame on you, Hakim Muhammad!\nArticle posted with permission

{"dataset": "propaganda-techniques", "split": "test", "setup_id": "propaganda-techniques", "example_idx": 39, "metadata": {"article": "699478811"}, "output": "Iranian Aggression Intensifies\n\nLast July, Major General Mohammad Bagheri, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) military commander and chief of staff of Iran\u2019s armed forces, warned that \u201cputting the Revolutionary Guard in the terrorist lists with terrorist groups can be very costly to the United States and its military bases and forces in the region.\u201d IRGC commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said on October 8th that \"if the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world.\"\nThe next day the Iranian regime warned of a \"crushing\" response if the United States were to designate the IRGC as a terrorist organization.\nPresident Trump has called the Iranian regime\u2019s bluff with his announcement last week that he would do just that.\nDesignating the IRGC as a terrorist organization and imposing new sanctions for its aggressive actions in the region is not a restoration of the sanctions lifted by the Obama administration as part of its disastrous nuclear deal with Iran.\nIf Iran insists it can do what it wants militarily in terms of missile launches, support of terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas, and arms transfers without violating the nuclear deal, then the United States can certainly act to curb such activities through financial pressure.\nThe U.S. can impose sanctions against the Iranian regime\u2019s principal instrument for projecting aggressive, destabilizing force outside of its borders without violating the nuclear deal.\nThe Iranian regime does not see it that way, however.\nWith the lifting of the nuclear-related sanctions making available billions of dollars to Iran\u2019s leaders to further finance the IRGC\u2019s exploits in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and elsewhere, the regime is furious that the Trump administration is tightening the financial screws again, even if for reasons not directly related to Iran\u2019s compliance with the terms of the nuclear deal.\nThus, it is threatening U.S. forces and bases in the region.\nA couple of seemingly unrelated events this past week point to Iran\u2019s positioning itself for more aggressive military actions that could place U.S. forces in harm\u2019s way.\nOn Tuesday, Major General Bagheri landed in Damascus for talks with Syrian President Bashar Assad and senior Syrian officials, including the defense minister and the chief of staff of the Syrian armed forces.\nBagheri is quoted as saying that his visit\u2019s purpose was to \u201cput a joint strategy on continuing co-ordination and co-operation at the military level.\u201d Some experts on Iran believe that Bagheri\u2019s visit to Damascus at this time is intended to reinforce a message that Iran will continue to supply weaponry to Syria and to reinforce the presence of its terrorist proxy Hezbollah in Syria.\nThis will not only serve to bolster the Assad regime, but it also will strengthen Iran's ability to follow through on its threats to the U.S. and its allies, principally Israel.\nMeanwhile, following the departure of the Kurds from Kirkuk, Iraq earlier this week, the IRGC\u2019s operational Al Qods arm reportedly established a command center and five bases there.\nAccording to Debkafile, this constitutes \u201cthe first military facility Iran has ever established openly in Iraq.\u201d The Kirkuk region holds 45 percent of Iraqi\u2019s oil.\nThe Iraqi branch of Iran\u2019s terrorist proxy Hezbollah has vowed that once ISIS is defeated it will start killing Americans, as it has done before.\nIt is against this backdrop that U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley used her entire speech to the UN Security Council on Wednesday to denounce the Iranian regime on multiple grounds.\nThe session was supposed to be devoted to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but Ambassador Haley departed from the monthly ritual during which Israel is normally singled out for criticism by other Council members.\nShe went after Iran instead.\nShe explained why the Trump administration decided to take \u201ca comprehensive approach to confronting the Iranian regime,\u201d which does not give the regime a get out of jail free card even if it is in technical compliance with the loophole-ridden nuclear deal agreed to by the Obama administration.\n\u201cWe can\u2019t talk about stability in the Middle East without talking about Iran,\u201d Ambassador Haley said.\n\u201cThat\u2019s because nearly every threat to peace and security in the Middle East is connected to Iran\u2019s outlaw behavior.\nThe United States has now embarked on a course that attempts to address all aspects of Iran\u2019s destructive conduct, not just one aspect.\nIt\u2019s critical that the international community do the same.\nJudging Iran by the narrow confines of the nuclear deal misses the true nature of the threat.\nIran must be judged in totality of its aggressive, destabilizing, and unlawful behavior.\nTo do otherwise would be foolish.\u201d\nAmbassador Haley accused the Iranian regime of continuing to \u201cplay\u201d the Security Council.\n\u201cIran hides behind its assertion of technical compliance with the nuclear deal while it brazenly violates the other limits on its behavior.\nAnd we have allowed them to get away with it.\nThis must stop.\u201d\nAmbassador Haley proceeded to list various violations by the Iranian regime of Security Council resolutions pertaining to the transfer of conventional weapons from Iran and the arming of terrorist groups, including the Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hezbollah.\nShe also pointed to what she called the Iranian regime\u2019s \u201cmost threatening act\u201d \u2013 its launch of ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons.\n\u201cWhen a rogue regime starts down the path of ballistic missiles, it tells us that we will soon have another North Korea on our hands,\u201d Ambassador Haley said.\n\u201cIf it is wrong for North Korea to do this, why doesn\u2019t that same mentality apply to Iran?\n\u201c\nAs for the Iran\u2019s supposed technical compliance with its commitments under the nuclear deal itself, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the UN\u2019s international inspectors are not able to visit Iran\u2019s military sites.\nPast work on nuclear explosive trigger devices appears to have taken place at one or more such sites in the past.\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Yukiya Amano admitted last month that when it comes to the IAEA\u2019s capacity to check whether Iran was conducting work on a nuclear explosive device, his agency\u2019s \u201ctools are limited.\u201d The Iranian regime has also attempted to skirt the restrictions in the JCPOA on its procurement of materials, equipment, goods and technology related to Iran\u2019s nuclear activities.\nThe Heritage Foundation noted in its recent report on the JCPOA, for example, that Iran was \u201ccaught red-handed trying to purchase nuclear technology and restricted ballistic missile technology from German companies.\u201d\nU.S. intelligence had discovered North Korea\u2019s transfer of missile parts to Iran at the very same time that Iran was negotiating the nuclear deal, in clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions then in effect.\nThe Obama administration chose to look the other way.\nDoes anybody with a modicum of sense really believe that such collaboration between the two rogue nations is not going on today?\nIran is flush with cash, thanks to the JCPOA.\nIt wants to build out its missile and nuclear enrichment capabilities.\nIn addition to covert transfers of materials and technology to Iran in violation of the nuclear deal, the JCPOA may provide a loophole for Iran to exploit in outsourcing some of the development work to North Korea for hard currency, which North Korea desperately needs.\nThey are a perfect match for each other.\nProponents of the JCPOA argue that exiting the nuclear deal unless it is changed to the Trump administration\u2019s satisfaction would undermine U.S. credibility with North Korea and thereby kill any chance of negotiations to resolve the crisis caused by North Korea's continued testing of sophisticated nuclear arms and ballistic missiles.\n\"If we want to talk to North Korea now, the possible end for the nuclear deal with Iran would jeopardize the credibility of such treaties,\" Reuters quoted German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel as saying.\nGermany is one of the parties to the JCPOA.\nOther European allies have voiced similar concerns.\nSo have Obama\u2019s former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John Kerry.\nThis argument is absurd on its face.\nThe whole point is to prevent Iran from becoming the next North Korea, not to kick the can down the road as

{"dataset": "propaganda-techniques", "split": "test", "setup_id": "propaganda-techniques", "example_idx": 41, "metadata": {"article": "699142854"}, "output": "THE OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS OF TRUMP'S IRAN INITIATIVE\n\nOriginally published the Jerusalem Post.\nOn Friday, US President Donald Trump initiated an important change in US policy toward Iran.\n\nNo, in his speech decertifying Iran\u2019s compliance with the nuclear accord it struck with his predecessor Barack Obama, Trump didn\u2019t announce a new strategy for preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, or stemming its hegemonic rise in the Middle East, or limiting its ability to sponsor terrorism.\nTrump\u2019s move was not operational.\nIt was directional.\n\nIn his address Friday, Trump changed the policy dynamics that dictate US policy on Iran.\nFor the first time since 2009, when Obama backed the murderous regime in Tehran, spurning the millions of Iranians who rose up in the Green Revolution, Trump opened up the possibility that the US may begin to base its policies toward Iran on reality.\n\nTrump began his remarks by setting out Iran\u2019s long rap sheet of aggression against America.\n\nStarting with the US embassy seizure and hostage crisis, Trump described Iran\u2019s crimes and acts of war against America in greater detail than any of his predecessors ever did.\n\nTrump\u2019s dossier was interlaced with condemnations of the regime\u2019s repression of its own people.\n\nBy merging Iran\u2019s external aggression with its internal repression, Trump signaled a readiness to drive a wedge \u2013 or expand the wedge \u2013 between the authoritarian theocrats that rule Iran and the largely secular, multiethnic and pro-Western people of Iran.\n\nTrump then turned his attention to Iran\u2019s illicit ballistic missile program, its sponsorship of terrorism, including its links to al-Qaida, its aggression against its neighbors, its aggressive acts against maritime traffic in the Straits of Hormuz, and its bids to destabilize and control large swaths of the Middle East through its proxies.\n\nIt is notable that these remarks preceded Trump\u2019s discussion of the nuclear deal \u2013 which was the ostensible subject of his speech.\nBefore Trump discussed Iran\u2019s breaches of the nuclear deal, he first demonstrated that contrary to the expressed views of his top advisers, it is impossible to limit a realistic discussion of the threat Iran constitutes to US national security and interests to whether or not and it what manner it is breaching the nuclear accord.\n\nThis was a critical point because for the past two years, US discourse on Iran has focused solely on whether or not Iran was complying with Obama\u2019s nuclear pact.\nBy placing the nuclear deal in the context of Iran\u2019s consistent, overarching hostility and aggression, Trump made it self-evident that no US interest is served in continuing to give Iran a free pass from congressional sanctions.\n\nAfter accomplishing that goal, Trump turned his attention to how Iran is actually breaching the letter and spirit of the nuclear pact.\nOnly then, almost as an afterthought, did he announce that he was decertifying Iranian compliance with the nuclear deal, setting the conditions for the renewal of congressional sanctions on Iran and opening the floodgates of congressional sanctions on Iran in retaliation for the full spectrum of its aggressive and illicit acts against the US, its interests and allies.\n\nBy empowering Congress to prohibit economic cooperation with Iran, Trump put the Europeans, Chinese and Russians on notice that they may soon face a choice between conducting business with the US and conducting business with Iran.\n\nAfter putting them on notice, Trump discussed the possibility of improving Obama\u2019s nuclear accord.\nAmong other things, he suggested expanding the inspection regime against Iran\u2019s nuclear installations and canceling the so-called \u201csunset\u201d clause that places an end date on the restrictions governing certain components of Iran\u2019s nuclear advancement.\n\nTrump\u2019s address has the potential to serve as the foundation of a major, positive shift in US policy toward Iran.\nSuch a shift could potentially facilitate the achievement of Trump\u2019s goals of preventing Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, containing its regional aggression and empowerment and defeating its terrorist proxies.\n\nUnfortunately, it is also likely, indeed, it is more likely, that his words will not be translated into policies to achieve these critical aims.\n\nTrump\u2019s decision to transfer immediate responsibility to Congress for holding Iran accountable for its hostile actions on the military and other fronts is a risky move.\nHe has a lot of enemies, and the nuclear deal has a lot of supporters on Capitol Hill.\n\nObama would have never been able to implement his nuclear deal if Senator Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, hadn\u2019t agreed to cast the Constitution aside and ignore Obama\u2019s constitutional duty to present the nuclear deal to the Senate for ratification as a treaty.\n\nOver the past week, Trump and Corker have been involved in an ugly public fight precipitated by Corker\u2019s announcement that he will not be seeking reelection next year.\n\nToday Corker has nothing to restrain him from scuttling Trump\u2019s agenda.\nIf he wishes, out of spite, Corker can block effective sanctions from being passed.\nAnd he may do so even though the implications for his Senate colleagues would be dire and even though doing so would render him an unofficial protector of Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\n\nWhat is true for Corker is doubly true for the Democrats.\n\nLeading Democratic senators like Robert Menendez, Ben Cardin and Chuck Schumer, who opposed Obama\u2019s Iran deal may now feel that as opponents of the Trump administration, they are required to oppose any change to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act.\n\nIndeed, given the rise of radical forces in their party it is likely that they would rather give Iran a free pass for its anti-American aggression and nuclear proliferation than work with Republicans on Capitol Hill and in the White House.\n\nThen again, by framing the issue of Iran\u2019s threat to America as he did, and by transferring responsibility for reinstating sanctions and passing further sanctions on Iran to Congress, Trump opened up the possibility that Congress will conduct substantive \u2013 rather than personal \u2013 debates on Iran.\n\nAnd the more substantive those debates become, the further away the US discourse will move from the mendacious assumptions of Obama\u2019s Iran policy \u2013 that the Iranian regime is a responsible actor and potential US ally, and that there is nothing inherently aggressive or problematic about Iran\u2019s illicit nuclear weapons program.\n\nThe second major risk inherent in Trump\u2019s approach is that he will get his way; that the Europeans, Russians and Chinese and the Iranians will agree to improve the nuclear deal.\nThe problem here is not obvious.\nClearly, it is better if the deal is amended to delete the sunset clauses and expand the inspections regime.\n\nYet even an amended, improved deal will still serve as a shield to Iran\u2019s nuclear program.\nAn improved deal won\u2019t destroy Iran\u2019s centrifuges.\n\nIt won\u2019t take away Iran\u2019s enriched uranium.\nIt won\u2019t destroy Iran\u2019s nuclear installations.\nAnd it won\u2019t bring down the regime which by its nature ensures all of these things will remain a menace to the US, its allies and international security as a whole.\n\nSo long as the US continues to maintain a policy based on the false view that all that is necessary to destroy the threat of a nuclear armed Iran is a combination of the nuclear deal and economic sanctions, it will continue to ensure that Iran and its nuclear program remain a major threat.\nDistressingly, US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, the most outspoken supporter of decertifying Iranian compliance in the Trump administration, told NBC on Sunday that the US intends to remain in the nuclear deal.\n\nTo understand what must be done we must return to Trump\u2019s speech and its strategic significance.\n\nBy taking a holistic view of the Iranian threat \u2013 grounded in a recognition of the inherent hostility of the regime \u2013 Trump opened up the possibility that the US and its allies can develop a holistic policy for confronting and defeating Iran and its proxies.\nIf the Iran deal and sanctions are two components to a larger strategy rather than the entire strategy, they can be helpful.\n\nA wider strategy would target Iran\u2019s regional aggression by weakening its proxies and clients from Hezbollah and Hamas to the regimes in Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Lebanon.\nIt would target the regime itself by empowering the ayatollahs\u2019 domestic opponents.\nIt would pin down Iranian forces by arming and otherwise assisting the Iraqi Kurds to defend and maintain their control over their territory along the Iranian border while strengthening the ties between Iranian Kurds and Iraqi Kurds.\n\nFriday, Trump created the possibility for such a strategy.\nIt is up to members of Congress, and US allies like Israel and the Sunni Arab states to help Trump conceive and implement it.\nIf they fail, the possibility Trump created will be lost, perhaps irrevocably."}

Curtis IV, the author of \u201cBlack Muslim Religion in the Nation of Islam,\u201d said that while estimates ranged wildly about how many bona fide members belonged to the Nation, he believes that there were tens of thousands of members in the 1960s and early 1970s.\nBut he said that millions of others sympathized with the movement\u2019s anticolonial stance and were inspired by its most famous member, Muhammad Ali.\n\nWho is Louis Farrakhan?\nBorn Louis Eugene Walcott in New York in 1933, Mr. Farrakhan joined the Nation of Islam in the mid-1950s and rose quickly within the organization, becoming close to Malcolm X.\nAfter the assassination of Malcolm X in 1965, he became one of the most powerful members of the Nation and its chief spokesman, the position that Malcolm X had held.\n\nThe Nation of Islam had gained followers around the nation in the 1940s and \u201950s by providing something of a religious answer to antiblack racism.\nIt was not widely recognized as an anti-Jewish organization during its early years (its early literature, though, focused on \u201cthe white man\u201d as \u201cthe white devil\u201d).\nBut in 1967, it became outspokenly and flagrantly anti-Zionist, in an expression of solidarity with Palestinians.\nThat political position became a vehicle for Mr. Farrakhan to express his anti-Semitism.\n(Among his more infamous comments is his 1984 description of Adolf Hitler as \u201ca very great man.\u201d)\n\nIn 1975, when Elijah Muhammad died, the Nation split into two factions.\nThe faction reconstituted under Mr. Farrakhan in the late 1970s retained the original name, though not the influence or support that it had when its leaders were Malcolm X, Muhammad Ali and Elijah Muhammad.\nMr. Curtis said that today the membership could be in the thousands, and there could even be as many as 10,000 followers.\nMr. Farrakhan, whose name, the Anti-Defamation League wrote after the February event, is \u201cvirtually synonymous with anti-Semitism,\u201d then drew national attention in 1984, when he exhorted his followers to support Jesse Jackson\u2019s bid for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nIn a radio address, he urged listeners to \u201cmake an example\u201d of a Washington Post reporter who had reported that Mr. Jackson had used anti-Semitic terms in private.\nMr. Jackson repudiated Mr. Farrakhan, but the minister\u2019s support proved troublesome to his 1988 campaign as well.\n\nHe was back in the news in 1995 when he organized what became known as the \u201cMillion Man March,\u201d a political and religious revival event in Washington.\n\nWhy were Tamika Mallory and Danny Davis reluctant to denounce him?\nMs. Mallory, who declined to comment for this article, did not respond to calls to condemn Mr. Farrakhan, for whom she had expressed admiration in the past.\n\nOn March 3, she said on Twitter that someone had brought to her attention that she had yet to tweet \u201cmy absolute position on how wrong anti-Semitism is.\u201d A day later, she said that she was \u201ccommitted to ending anti-black racism, anti-Semitism, homophobia & transphobia,\u201d but did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.\n\nIn an essay posted Wednesday, she said that she had been attending Saviour\u2019s Day celebrations for over 30 years.\n\n\u201cIn that most difficult period of my life, it was the women of the Nation of Islam who supported me and I have always held them close to my heart for that reason,\u201d she said.\nThe essay did not mention Mr. Farrakhan.\nAsked what the appeal of Mr. Farrakhan\u2019s views might be to people like Ms. Mallory, religious scholars emphasized that the Nation of Islam is a religion and can provide comfort and aid to its adherents.\n\n\u201cFor those who find it appealing, it is a form of radical black self love that is willing to challenge any potential impediment to black freedom,\u201d Mr. Curtis said.\n\nYvonne Chireau, a professor of religion at Swarthmore who called Mr. Farrakhan\u2019s remarks about Jews \u201cunbelievably vile,\u201d emphasized that his fundamentalism was comparable to the fundamentalist views found in other religions.\n\nCoincidentally, the photo of Mr. Farrakhan and Mr. Obama had been published by the Trice Edney News Wire in January.\nThe News Wire reported that the picture had been taken by the photojournalist Askia Muhammad during a 2005 meeting of the Congressional Black Caucus and that Mr. Muhammad kept the photo under wraps so as not to hurt Mr. Obama\u2019s candidacy.\n\n(Mr. Muhammad, in a 2012 blog post, said that he was an admirer of Mr. Farrakhan and that the minister was not an anti-Semite.\nHe reaffirmed that he admired Mr. Farrakhan in an interview on Friday, though he said that the things the minister says about Jewish people \u201csometimes make me shudder.\u201d)\n\nKatie Hill, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, said on Friday: \u201cPresident Obama has denounced racism and anti-Semitism his entire life.\nThat includes his public and repeated repudiations of Louis Farrakhan\u2019s views over the years.\nToday is no different \u2014 he still rejects the harmful and divisive views Farrakhan continues to espouse.\u201d\n\nRepresentative Davis, who was interviewed by The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, after the photo emerged, called Mr. Farrakhan an \u201coutstanding human being,\u201d and later said he was not bothered by the leader\u2019s position on \u201cThe Jewish Question.\u201d\n\nAfter a monthlong backlash about that interview, largely in conservative media, Mr. Davis said in a statement to Forward on Thursday that \u201cI reject, condemn and oppose Minister Farrakhan\u2019s views and remarks regarding the Jewish people and the Jewish religion.\u201d"}

in other words, don\u2019t worry, folks, it\u2019s all scientifically objective.\nThis research is being used to advise companies who host online platforms, such as Facebook, as well as governments, on how to stamp out online radicalization \u2013 using strategies such as working out ways of preventing people from seeing material posted that is deemed unsuitable in some way, or offering them alternative \u201cnice\u201d things to look at.\nThis is a seriously important issue.\nThe people and political powers behind such initiatives are manipulating behavior online and literally controlling how people think and get information.\nThey are the appointed guardians of the online hoi polloi.\nBut who guards the guardians?\nFor if Dr. Ganesh is in charge, we have some very worrying questions to ask.\nOne could start from the observation that the article is certainly not an academic piece, and gives no concrete evidence for any of the sweeping claims it makes about the so-called \u201calt-right\u201d and the \u201cmanosphere\u201d; nor does it, as any academic should do, attempt to test ideas and consider alternative explanations.\n(Oddly enough, this makes it rather like the groups it claims to criticize.)\nAnd the label of \u201cviolent extremist\u201d turns out to be used very generously.\nGanesh makes wild leaps and inferences.\nHe talks of Darren Osborne, the perpetrator of the vehicular attack on Finsbury Park Mosque.\nThis was a heinous crime, and should rightly be condemned.\nBut why did Osborne do this, according to Ganesh?\nThe attack \u201cwas executed after he had become indignant after watching a BBC broadcast on child sexual exploitation and turned to social media to make sense of it.\nHe found a narrative from British counter-jihad groups closely aligned with the alt-right, such as Britain First and the founder of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson.\u201d The British counter-jihad movement is thus swept into the same group of violent extremists as Osborne, because Ganesh \u201cknows\u201d they encouraged him.\nThe BBC broadcast was the drama based on real life, Three Girls, which showed real-life events of three of the (very many) victims of the Rochdale Muslim rape gangs.\nGanesh somehow knows precisely what went on in Osborne\u2019s mind.\nRather than thinking that it was outrage at the behavior of the gangs of Muslim men of Pakistani background who abused the girls portrayed in Three Girls that caused Osborne to lose his mind and commit his terrible crime, Ganesh blames Obsorne\u2019s act on the likes of Tommy Robinson.\nYet Robinson explicitly fights AGAINST political violence.\nWhat \u201cnarrative from British counter-jihad groups\u201d can one find which suggests driving vehicles into innocent Muslims standing outside a mosque?\nI\u2019m sure if there was any, Ganesh would, as a researcher at an elite institution, be able to find it.\nBut there is none offered \u2013 only surmise and Ganesh\u2019s mindreading techniques.\nI suppose if you\u2019re paid to fight online extremism, you\u2019d better find it, or you\u2019re out of a job and short of academic publication.\nWe have also the ridiculous idea that Tommy Robinson is \u201calt-right.\u201d He, in fact, describes himself as a centrist \u2013 he\u2019s said he agrees with Labour on some things, the Tories on other things, and he left the EDL precisely because he didn\u2019t like the infiltration by the far right.\nHe shows no hint of racism or of white supremacism.\nThe writer of this shoddy article is working at one of the most elite universities in the world, on research funded by the European Union, and giving advice based on this sloppy thinking to those who are in charge of manipulating and policing the communications and information we have online.\nWe have to ask.\nIs it simply a coincidence that Tommy Robinson is now in prison, and that a \u201cresearcher\u201d who presents such a misleading account of Robinson is currently actively engaged in consultation with Oxford University and the European Union in advising how to disrupt Robinson\u2019s activities, reinforcing the lies and misrepresentations about him to those in power?\nThere\u2019s more.\nBharath Ganesh\u2019s profile tells us this: \u201cDuring his Ph.D., Bharath was also a Senior Researcher at Tell MAMA, a national project dedicated to mapping and monitoring anti-Muslim hate in the United Kingdom.\nHe has given evidence in the Houses of Parliament on governance, extremism, gender, and hate crime and authored a number of reports in this area.\u201d\nIs it simply a coincidence that this \u201cresearcher,\u201d prior to coming to Oxford University, worked for Tell Mama, that factory for the production of bogus claims about Islamophobia?\nWho runs the Internet runs the world.\nIs this a partnership between Europe\u2019s governments, the Internet giants, and Islamic influence?\nArticle posted with permission from Pamela Geller"}

correspondent Jim Acosta\u2019s press credential\n\nCNN has won the first round of its legal battle to get correspondent Jim Acosta back in the White House.\nU.S. District Court Judge Timothy Kelly granted the cable news network\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction Friday that restored Acosta\u2019s White House press credential.\nKelly ordered that Acosta be reinstated immediately.\nHe did not rule on CNN\u2019s claim that the revocation of the journalist\u2019s pass violated his rights under the First Amendment.\nBut he said the White House did not provide Acosta with due process to legally remove his pass.\nThe ruling followed a court hearing held Wednesday in Washington, where lawyers for CNN and the White House faced off over the issue of press access.\nCNN had the broad support of other news organizations that believed the White House\u2019s actions posed a challenge to press freedom.\n\u201cWe are gratified with this result and we look forward to a full resolution in the coming days,\u201d a CNN representative said in a statement.\n\u201cOur sincere thanks to all who have supported not just CNN, but a free, strong and independent American press.\u201d\nThe White House said it would abide by Kelly\u2019s ruling.\n\u201cToday, the court made clear there is no absolute right to access the White House.\nIn response to the court, we will temporarily reinstate the reporter\u2019s hard pass,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement.\n\u201cWe will also further develop rules and processes to ensure fair and orderly press conferences in the future.\nThere must be decorum in the White House.\u201d\nAcosta\u2019s press credential was revoked by the White House on Nov. 7 after a testy exchange with President Donald Trump at a White House news conference.\nAt one point, Acosta refused to relinquish the microphone to a White House aide who tried to retrieve it from him.\nIt was the latest in a series of public confrontations between Acosta and Trump, who has repeatedly characterized CNN\u2019s critical coverage of him as \u201cfake news\u201d since the 2016 presidential campaign.\nCNN\u2019s suit filed Tuesday says the suspension of Acosta\u2019s credential violates the First Amendment\u2019s protection of free speech.\nIt also says the way the administration revoked the pass, with no direct notice to Acosta or a written explanation detailing the decision, violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s protection of due process and the federal Administrative Procedures Act.\n\u201cThis severe and unprecedented punishment is the culmination of years of hostility by President Trump against CNN and Acosta based on the contents of their reporting \u2014 an unabashed attempt to censor the press and exclude reporters from the White House who challenge and dispute the president\u2019s point of view,\u201d the suit says.\nResponding to the CNN suit, lawyers for the White House said the Trump administration had broad discretion to regulate access to journalists and other members of the public.\n\u201cIf the president wants to exclude all reporters from the White House grounds, he has the authority to do that,\u201d Deputy Assistant Attorney General James Burnham said during the hearing.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no First Amendment right.\u201d\nThe White House argued that Acosta\u2019s behavior, which it described as rude and aggressive, was the reason for revoking his credential.\nMark Lukasiewicz, dean of The Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University and a former network news executive, praised the judge\u2019s decision, which he said was not a surprise.\n\u201cThe White House has lots of other ways to deal with the behavior of reporters if that\u2019s their concern, but closing the gate to a news organization is not one of these ways, and it\u2019s important that the court stood up and said that,\u201d Lukasiewicz said.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the first time a reporter has behaved in a way that a president doesn\u2019t like.\u201d\nLukasiewicz believed CNN would reach a compromise with the White House rather than engage in a prolonged court battle.\n\u201cThe law and the Constitution is very clear here,\u201d he said.\nCNN\u2019s suit received the support of more than a dozen news organizations including Fox News, where commentators have often echoed Trump\u2019s criticisms of the network\u2019s coverage.\nRival news organizations came to the defense of Fox News in 2009 when the Obama administration attempted to exclude its reporters from interviews with officials that were offered to all other outlets.\nFox News commentators were President Barack Obama\u2019s harshest critics during his eight years in office, and he often complained about it in public and private.\nBut the press credentials for its conservative-leaning network were never revoked.\nFox News, The Washington Post, NBC News, The Associated Press and the Los Angeles Times are among the entities that have said they will file amicus briefs on behalf of CNN.\n\u2014 Stephen Battaglio\nLos Angeles

Purge Should TERRIFY Everyone: Soon Those Who Hate Freedom Will Have Unquestioned Access to the Minds of 2 Billion People\n\nYesterday, the alternative media purge was boldly advanced in a coordinated effort to silence people who dissent from establishment views.\nIt\u2019s just one more step toward a monopoly on information by those who hate freedom.\nAt this rate, they\u2019ll soon have unquestioned access to the minds of more than 2 billion people.\nAnd this should terrify everyone who wants to be free to question the status quo and to seek a wide range of information.\nHundreds of alternative media site administrators logged onto Facebook to discover that their accounts had been removed.\nSoon after, many of these sites and their writers found that their Twitter accounts had also been suspended.\nPopular pages like The AntiMedia (2.1 million fans), The Free Thought Project (3.1 million fans), Press for Truth (350K fans), Police the Police (1.9 million fans), Cop Block (1.7 million fans), and Punk Rock Libertarians (125K fans) are just a few of the ones which were unpublished.\nWhy were these alternative media accounts removed?\ntake our poll - story continues

Freedom Outpost updates free of charge.\nYou may opt out at anytime.\nYou also agree to this site's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\nThe reason given doesn\u2019t really add up.\nFacebook told the LA Times that these pages had violated the company\u2019s spam policies.\n\u201cToday, we\u2019re removing 559 Pages and 251 accounts that have consistently broken our rules against spam and coordinated inauthentic behavior,\u201d the company said in a blog post.\n\u201cPeople will only share on Facebook if they feel safe and trust the connections they make here.\u201d (source)\nBut this isn\u2019t actually what their spam policy says.\nHere\u2019s the policy.\nWe work hard to limit the spread of commercial spam to prevent false advertising, fraud, and security breaches, all of which detract from people\u2019s ability to share and connect.\nWe do not allow people to use misleading or inaccurate information to collect likes, followers, or shares.\nDo Not: Artificially increase distribution for financial gain\nCreate or use fake accounts or compromise other people\u2019s accounts to\nImpersonate or pretend to be a business, organization, public figure, or private individual\nAttempt to create connections, create content, or message people\nRestrict access to content by requiring people to like, share, or recommend before viewing\nEncourage likes, shares, or clicks under false pretenses\nMaliciously use login credentials or personally identifiable information by:\nAttempting to gather or share login credentials or personally identifiable information\nUsing another person\u2019s login credentials or personally identifiable information\nPromise non-existent Facebook features (source)\nThe Washington Post originally said that these pages were purged for \u201cpushing political messages for profit\u201d as you can see by their URL:\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/10/11/facebook-purged-over-accounts-pages-pushing-political-messages-profit/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.fa1a364488b3\nBut of course, since they too push political messages for profit (waaah, Trump!)\nas do all the other corporate media outlets out there, they changed their headline to \u201cFacebook purged over 800 U.S. accounts and pages for pushing political spam.\u201d\nThe fact that many of these accounts were also suspended by Twitter shortly thereafter should tell you that this is a coordinated effort to silence large swaths of the population.\nOf course, the best coverage of this is from\u2026Russia.\nSputnik News contacted many of the alternative journalists who were purged to get their take on what happened.\nYou may recall that basically every blogger outside the establishment media was accused of being secretly Russian during the 2016 election by the Washington Post, so perhaps actual Russians have a vested interest in the truth coming out on this topic.\nMy friend John Vibes is an amazing person who contributes to The Free Thought Project.\nHe said:\nThis signifies a re-consolidation of the media.\nCable news media controlled the narrative for most of modern history, but the internet has lowered that barrier to entry and allowed the average person to become the media themselves.\nThis obviously took market share and influence away from the traditional media, and it has allowed for a more diverse public conversation.\nNow it seems the platforms that have monopolized the industry are favoring mainstream sources and silencing alternative voices.\nSo now, instead of allowing more people to have a voice, these platforms are creating an atmosphere where only powerful media organizations are welcome, just as we had on cable news.\nPeople think that we are just providing an activist spin on the news, but they don\u2019t see the families struggling to have their voice heard.\nFor example, when someone is shot by police, mainstream media sources often just republish the press release from the police department, without presenting the victim\u2019s side of the story.\nWe give the victims and their families a voice, which is essential to keep power in check.\nThis also goes for bigger issues like foreign policy as well; multiple full-scale invasions of Syria have been prevented because of information that the alternative media made viral.\n(source)\nNicholas Bernabe of The AntiMedia is another alternative journalist I consider a friend and support wholeheartedly.\nHe\u2019s worked tirelessly to be a voice of truth in a world of lies.\nHe told Sputnik:\nOur approach generally is to cover stories and angles that corporate media underreport or misreport and to amplify activist and anti-war voices and stories.\nAll of our content is professionally fact-checked and edited.\nI got into this line of work because I felt there was a need for media that challenged mainstream assumptions and biases in politics.\nI wanted to shed light on corruption and wrongdoing against oppressed peoples and cover the harsh truth about American foreign policy.\nOver the last 28 days, we reached 7,088,000 people on Facebook.\nThe timing of this purge is rather dubious in my view, coming shortly before the midterm elections.\nThis could be an attempt by Facebook itself to affect the outcome of the coming elections.\nThe Twitter suspension caught me by surprise.\nI can only speculate that these suspensions were a coordinated effort to stifle our message ahead of the coming elections.\n(source)\nRemember, this is coordinated, across multiple platforms.\nRemember when this happened to Alex Jones?\nBack in September, an assault was led by YouTube, Google, and Facebook against Alex Jones of Infowars fame.\nAll of his accounts were shut down in quick succession, followed by his credit card processing companies and his newsletter service providers.\nI wrote at the time, \u201cAlex Jones is just the beginning of this purge.\nIt\u2019s going to get much worse.\u201d\nMeanwhile, other dissenting voices were being silenced on social media with limited reach and \u201cshadow banning.\u201d\nInfowars is a massive profit machine.\nBut what happens when similar attacks are launched on smaller alternative media outlets?\nIt hits us right in the wallet.\nAnd if they\u2019re hit hard enough, they\u2019ll cease to be able to function.\nJones has a lot of money so this may not be the end of him, but for most website owners, this would be the absolute end of our ability to do business.\nAnd to be able to bring the information we bring, we do have to run our websites as businesses.\nIt\u2019s far more expensive than most people realize to run a site.\nI know that my own operating costs every month are more than $2000.\nA site as big as Jones\u2019s would be many times that amount.\nWhen all your avenues of monetization are cut off, it wouldn\u2019t be hard for a site \u2013 and the dissent and information they share \u2013 to cease to exist.\n(source)\nThis is not just about Facebook or Twitter.\nIt\u2019s about the ability to find dissenting information, period.\nGoogle is in on it too.\nA leaked document from Google supported the idea of censorship.\nAnother Google document has found its way into the public domain, this time through Breitbart.\nThe news publication reports that an 85-page briefing entitled \u201cThe Good Censor,\u201d advises tech companies to \u201cpolice tone instead of content\u201d and to not \u201ctake sides\u201d when censoring users\u2026 Google might continue to shift with the times \u2013 changing its stance on how much or how little it censors (due to public, governmental or commercial pressures).\nIf it does, acknowledgment of what this shift in position means for users and for Google is essential.\nShifting blindly or silently in one direction or another rightly incites users\u2019 fury\u2026 The Google \u201cinternal research\u201d even quotes outside experts like George Soros who express justification of censorship in non-U.S. markets, noting that Google should police \u201ctone instead of content\u201d and \u201ccensor everyone equally,\u201d as Breitbart put it.\n(source)\nThere are 2 trillion Google searches per day.\nPER.\nDAY.\nThat should give you an idea of the power of something like Google.\nCombine it with billions of Facebook and Twitter users and you can easily see the influence wielded here.\nThis is where free thought goes to die.\nRon Paul reminds us that truth is treason.\nRon Paul, former senator and the libertarian voice of reason, said when Jones was purged:\n\u201cYou get accused of treasonous activity and treasonous speech because in an empire of lies the truth is treason,\u201d Paul told the Russia-based news outlet.\n\u201cChallenging the status quo is what they can\u2019t stand and it unnerves them, so they have to silence people.\u201d \u201cSome of us tell the truth about our government, they call us treasonous and say we\u2019re speaking out of line and they\u2019d like to punish us, and I think that\u2019s part of what\u2019s happening with social media,\u201d Paul told RT, adding that he hopes anti-government or anti-war voices can eliminate their \u201cdependency\u201d on the current social media platforms.\n\u201cI\u2019m just hoping that technology can stay ahead of it all and that we can have real alternatives to the dependency on Twitter and other companies that have been working hand in glove with the government,\u201d Paul added.\n(source)\nHere\u2019s a video from last month with Dr. Paul\u2019s thoughts about the social media purge.\nIn it, he reminds us that Facebook is a private entity so they do have every right to remove the pages they wish.\nThe danger \u2013 and the area in which this treads on the First Amendment \u2013 is their direct ties to the government.\nThis affects everyone.\nIf you\u2019re reading this and you shrug because you, personally, don\u2019t have a Twitter or Facebook account, you\u2019re missing the bigger point.\nConsider the fact that the \u201cpopulation\u201d of Facebook is bigger than the populations of the US, China, and Brazil combined.\nThat\u2019s how many people will now only receive one side of the story on things like war, politics, guns, and current events.\nPeople will believe what they\u2019re told because there is no alternative information presented.\nThere are no questions asked.\nIt\u2019s literally the textbook definition of brainwashing.\nDefinition of brainwashing\n1: a forcible indoctrination to induce someone to give up basic political, social, or religious beliefs and attitudes and to accept contrasting regimented ideas 2: persuasion by propaganda or salesmanship (source)\n(Here\u2019s an article from Psychology Today that discusses how Facebook is, in fact, brainwashing people for profit.)\nSocial media is a massive source of information and influence today.\nIf the information is rigged by entities that support socialism, gun control, and the end of privacy, we\u2019re doomed.\n2.2 billion active users will be bombarded with these messages without any real option for the other side of the story.\nSo regardless of whether you, personally, participate, this will color popular sentiment to a massive degree.\nIt will grow the cognitive dissonance that assures people of things like \u201cthe government is your friend\u201d and that \u201cyou don\u2019t need to protect yourself, the police will take care of you.\u201d\nPeople who hate freedom will get unfettered access to the minds of 2 billion people.\nThat should scare the crap out of you.\nWhat can you do about the alternative media purge?\nIt\u2019s possible but unlikely that social pressure on Facebook and Twitter will push the outlets into restoring the accounts of these alternative media networks.\nBut even if they are restored, I suspect their reach will dwindle even further.\nHere are a few things you can do:\nSubscribe to the newsletters of websites you enjoy.\nDon\u2019t count on seeing their work on social media.\n(You can subscribe to my newsletter here, incidentally.)\nSupport them financially if you can.\nMany sites have Patreon accounts or donate buttons\nBookmark them and visit regularly \u2013 if they have ads, your visits help them to make the money they need to stay afloat.\nShare their articles on your own social media accounts.\nIf they can\u2019t get their work out there, we can help.\nJoin alternative social media outlets like Gab and MeWe.\nThe truth is getting harder and harder to find.\nYou\u2019re going to have to dig for it.\nWe\u2019re watching the biggest campaign against freedom of speech and thought that has ever occurred in our part of the world.\nThe alternative media purge is just the beginning.\nAnd we should all be very concerned.\nArticle posted with

Dr. Paul Craig Roberts Best Price: $11.96 Buy New $19.34 (as of 10:15 EDT - Details) From here relations between the two nuclear powers deteriorated rapidly.\nAs I and Stephen Cohen have emphasized, the danger of nuclear war is today far higher than ever during the long Cold War as there is today no trust whatsoever between the two governments.\nDonald Trump is totally correct that nuclear war would be a terminable event and that nothing is more important than restoring a cooperative and mutually respectful relationship between the US and Russia.\nThe problem is that the military/security complex sees it differently.\nAfter 70 years of entrenchment the military/security complex is an independent political force.\nPresident Eisenhower warned the American people about this likely outcome in 1961 to no avail.\nFrom the standpoint of the military/security complex, the problem of normalizing relations with Russia is that it downgrades the \u201cRussian threat\u201d that is so essential to the $1,000 billion annual budget of the military/security complex and the power that such a massive budget conveys.\nOnly 16 countries in the world out of 195 countries have a GDP greater than $1,000 billion.\nThe military/security complex is large enough to be a member of the G-20 and to have its own currency and military.\nObama\u2019s CIA director, John Brennan, quickly organized the Russiagate conspiracy against Trump.\nComey, Rosenstein, Clapper, Mueller, McCabe, Peter Strzok and others were, and are, apparently implicated as active participants in orchestrating an alleged collusion between Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin to steal the US presidential election.\nBased on deception of the FISA Court, warrants were illegally obtained that became the basis for appointing Mueller as a special prosecutor to construct by whatever means possible a case against President Trump.\nAfter two years the only evidence we have of Russiagate is that it is a conspiracy against President Trump and the American people.\nIndeed, Mueller, fully aware that there was no Trump-Putin conspiracy, has not bothered to look for any evidence as there can be no evidence of something that did not happen.\nHe pulled out of a hat some phony and meaningless indictments of some Russians in order to make it look like there was a conspiracy without having to prove it, but his main focus has been on framing Paul Manafort.\nMueller\u2019s investigation of Manafort has nothing to do with the Russiagate story line.\nManafort\u2019s alleged crimes are far outside Mueller\u2019s mandate and took place, if they did, years before the alleged events of Russiagate.\nManafort\u2019s conviction by a jury on 8 of the 18 counts is being misrepresented by the Trump-hating presstitutes as vindication of the Russiagate investigation and as \u201cA dark day for Trump,\u201d with the presstitutes suggesting a Watergate parallel that will force Trump from office.\nManafort was found guilty not of Russiagate, but of income tax evasion and misrepresenting his financial position on a loan application.\nWe do not know if Manafort is guilty or is simply a victim of Mueller\u2019s frameup and an incompetent jury.\nAmerican juries are notoriously incompetent, which is why 97% of felony indictments are settled with a plea bargain.\nEven the innocent had rather work out a plea arrangement and admit to something that they did not do than to face an insouciant American jury.\nRemember the jury that condemned the survivors of the FBI\u2019s massacre of the Branch Davidians in Waco, Texas, to be locked away for many years so that they could not talk and tell of the mass murder inflicted on a religious group by the FBI.\nIt is unclear how much of a crime it can be to misrepresent your financial position on a loan application when one of the causes of the mortgage-backed derivative crisis was the misrepresentation of mortgage applicants on the loan documents by the companies issuing the mortgages.\nInstead of prosecution, Washington relied on the Federal Reserve to bail out the banks holding the misrepresented loans.\nIncome tax invasion is the purview of the IRS, not of a special prosecutor who is supposed to be looking for evidence of a Trump-Putin conspiracy.\nThe Russia Hoax: The I... Gregg Jarrett Best Price: $13.99 Buy New $12.63 (as of 08:40 EDT - Details)\nSo, why did Mueller focus on Manafort?\nLet Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz tell you:\n\u201cAll the Special Counsel needs, in order to charge a subject of an investigation with lying to a prosecutor, is a single witnesses willing to contradict the subject.\n\u201cThe witness may not only be \u201csinging,\u201d he may also be \u201ccomposing\u201d \u2014 that is, making up or embellishing a story because he knows that the better his story, the better the deal.\n\u201cUnder federal law, the testimony of such a \u201cflipped witness\u201d need not be corroborated in order to secure a conviction.\n\u201cEven one question that results in an answer that is contradicted by one witness would be enough to spring the perjury trap.\u201d\nPresident Trump has made various statements disputing the orchestrated Russiagate accusations that, if Manafort as witness for the Special Prosecutor contradicted, could send the President of the United States to prison for perjury.\nKnowing this, Mueller, in my opinion a proven corrupt person, decided to put the squeeze on Manafort in order to force Manafort to save himself by giving false testimony against Trump.\nThis tactic is used every day by state, local, and federal prosecutors.\nAmericans who believe the indictments and convictions are unaware that 97% of the time the convictions rest on self-incrimination in order to avoid worse punishment.\nIn Manafort\u2019s case it didn\u2019t, or hasn\u2019t, worked.\nYet.\nManafort is due for a second trial, this time for allegely acting as an unregistered foreign agent for Ukrainian interests and for making false statements not under oath to the US government.\nReportedly, Manafort is being held in solitary confinement, a form of torture designed to break a person\u2019s spirit.\nLike Manafort\u2019s first trial, his second trial has nothing whatsoever to do with Russiagate, but you will never learn that from the presstitute media or from the Democratic Party.\nManafort can still be coerced to say something that can be used to drive Trump from office.\nWhat about Michael Cohen, a former attorney for Trump?\nMueller saw no value in the Cohen case and passed it off to a regular US attorney to prosecute.\nTherefore, it would appear not to be part of the Russiagate investigation.\nCohen avoided a jury and said he was guilty of five counts of personal income tax evasion, one count of making a false statement to a financial institution in order to get a loan, and two counts related to illegal campaign contributions.\nWith regard to the campagin contributions, he contradicted his previous statements.\nHe said that on Trump\u2019s instruction, he paid off two women who were claiming sexual affairs with Trump.\nThe intricacies of American laws relating to politics are often unclear.\nApparently, the charge is that Cohen used monies raised for a political campaign to pay off two women, who saw and capitalized on an opportunity to extort Trump for money, and this was an illegal use of the money.\nWhy a lawyer would pay off women, whose stories might or might not be true, in an illegal way when his client is a multi-billionaire doesn\u2019t make much sense.\nBut these are not the kind of questions that the presstitutes are interested in.\nNevertheless, Cohen\u2019s plea is associated with a case brought by another prosecutor, not by Special Prosecutor Mueller.\nI am not sufficiently familiar with US legal procedures to be able to say how this gets brought back into Mueller\u2019s investigation.\nThe facts are this:\nThe US military/security complex will not permit any normalization of relations with Russia.\nPeriod.\nAt some point Putin and Lavrov and the idiot Russian Atlanticist Integrationists will have to acknowledge this fact, or Russia will be destroyed.\nTrump, by declaring normalization of relations as one of his two principal goals for his presidency, earned the emnity of the powerful military/security complex.\nBy defeating Hillary for the presidency, Trump inflamed the US media\u2019s hatred, committed as the presstitutes are to Identity Politics and hatred of the \u201cwhite male oppressors\u201d who elected Trump.\nTrump will never be forgiven for preventing the election of the first female president of the United States, an unpardonable crime by a misogynist white male who \u201cgrabs women by the pussy.\u201d\nThe hatred of Trump by the military/security complex and by the white male hating Identity Politics of the Democratic Party is giving the world the spectacle of an American democratic presidential election being overthrown by a conspiracy between the military/security complex, the Democratic Party, and the whores who constitute the American print and TV media.\nDeath of a Nation: Pla...

Bush regime.\nCheney turned the environmental protection regulatory agencies over to industry polluters.\nTrump is wrong on Iran.\nHe is in Israel\u2019s hands, hoping that the power of the Israel Lobby can shield him from the presstitutes and the military/security complex.\nWhat Israel is doing by attempting to use US military force against Iran is unifying a new alliance that is too powerful for the Washington/Israeli alliance.\nRussia, China, Syria, Turkey, Iran, India, and Pakistan are the locations of populations that massively outnumber Washington\u2019s empire.\nEach of these countries are being united by Washington\u2019s stupid and inexplicable actions against each.\nMilitarily, Israel is of no consequence.\nTwice the vaunted Israeli Army, capable of nothing but murdering unarmed women and children, were defeated and driven out of southern Lebanon by a few thousand Hezbollah militia.\nIsrael is too cowardly to try it a third time, and is relying on the stupid Americans to do the job for them.\nThe entire world looks at America and Israel, and what does the world see?\nTwo countries, both the result of exterminating the native populations, distrusted and universally hated, both of which survive by purhasing the governments of other countries and by endless lies that describe everyone but themselves and their vassals as evil criminals that must be destroyed.\nFor example, the Gaza Strip, the largest concentration camp ever in the world, is being systematically destroyed along with all life within it by Israel under cover of the obvious and transparanent lie that all within Gaza are terrorists outfitted with bomb belts who are committed to the destruction of Israel.\nNot only men of fighting age, but also old men, pregnant women, children, all Palestinians are being murdered by the Israeli military.\nThe United States Secretary of State agrees with Israel that all Palestinians must be destroyed, the sooner the better.\nThe Chinese are busy taking advantage of the financial opportunities that the idiot Americans forfeit, but otherwise do not seem to have any strategic sense of how to proceed in the drama unfolding in front of their eyes.\nFor China, money is now all.\nThe Russians are infected with the American propaganda infused into their veins during the Yeltsin era when Russia was an American puppet state.\nSlowly, if not surely, the Russians are coming to their senses and realizing that they have no American \u201cpartner.\u201d\nIf Trump is defeated and moved off the table, what happens when Russia and China finally realize that there is to be no conciliation with Washington?\nWhen all the false hopes and bets of the Russian and Chinese governments of conciliation on the basis of mutual economic interests come to naught, what happens?\nIt will be the end of life on earth.\nThe Russiagate \u201cinvestigation\u201d appears to be timed to influence the midterm elections with unsubstantiated accusations made just before the elections in an attempt to produce a Democratic Congress that would impeach President Trump on false charges.\nThe presstitutes would cover up the frameup.\nIn other words, the real election meddling is being done by the Russiagate \u201cinvestigation.\u201d See here and here.\nSuch an impeachment would be a coup.\nThe consequence would be deep and permanent divisions in American political life and more rabid Russiaphobia that would result in war.\nThe danger is real that the Democrats\u2019 Russiagate \u201cinvestigation\u201d aided and abetted by the presstitute media will result in nuclear Armageddon.\nThe Best of Paul Craig Roberts"}

Curtain Is Pulled Back In Washington DC\n\nAl Franken Is Just The Beginning As The Curtain Is Pulled Back In Washington DC\nPlease help support us with cryptocurrency donations.\nThank you!\nFor decades, Americans have known that very sick things happen behind the scenes in Washington D.C., but the mainstream media nearly really talks about any of it.\nBut now the curtain is starting to be pulled back, and the revelations about Al Franken are just the beginning.\nEarlier this week, I wrote an article about how \u201csexual harassment is rampant in the halls of Congress\u201d, and that was before a female radio anchor named LeeAnn Tweeden revealed that Al Franken had \u201cforcibly kissed\u201d and groped her during a USO tour in 2006.\nThe following comes from an article in which Tweeden shared her story\u2026\nI couldn\u2019t believe it.\nHe groped me, without my consent, while I was asleep.\nI felt violated all over again.\nEmbarrassed.\nBelittled.\nHumiliated.\nHow dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it\u2019s funny?\nI told my husband everything that happened and showed him the picture.\nI wanted to shout my story to the world with a megaphone to anyone who would listen, but even as angry as I was, I was worried about the potential backlash and damage going public might have on my career as a broadcaster.\nBut that was then, this is now.\nI\u2019m no longer afraid.\nWhen the story initially broke, Franken rushed to issue an apology\u2026\n\u201cI certainly don\u2019t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann,\u201d said Franken.\n\u201cAs to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn\u2019t.\nI shouldn\u2019t have done it.\u201d\nNeedless to say, many were completely unsatisfied with Franken\u2019s very weak statement.\nIn fact, some members of his own party said that his apology was entirely insufficient and are calling for Franken to be held accountable for his actions\u2026\nGuy Cecil, the former head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and now the boss of a leading Democratic super PAC, voiced his frustration with the inadequacy of Franken\u2019s apology on Twitter.\n\u201cThat was not an apology and was an insufficient response to serious allegations,\u201d Cecil tweeted.\n\u201cAl Franken must be held accountable if our party wants to live up to our commitment to women & girls.\u201d\nThis scandal has set off a feeding frenzy as Internet sleuths search for other incidents in which Franken has acted inappropriately.\nAnd of course, since we are talking about Al Franken, it wasn\u2019t exactly difficult to find material.\nFor example, a photo has surfaced of Franken grabbing Joy Behar in a very creepy manner.\nThe following comes from Breitbart\u2026\nAmid the emergence of a 2006 photo of Al Franken groping journalist and talk radio anchor Leeann Tweeden, a photo of the embattled Minnesota Senator appearing to grab comedian Joy Behar\u2019s breast has also resurfaced.\nFranken was a comedian before he ever entered the world of politics, and we understand that.\nBut just because he was a comedian does not mean that he gets to play by a different set of rules.\nThere appears to be an ongoing pattern of behavior, and Fox News has documented some of the other incidents that have come up in the past\u2026\nFranken, then a comedian, was quoted in a 1995 New York Magazine article discussing a skit for \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d that involved drugging and raping CBS reporter Lesley Stahl.\nFranken, at the time a writer for \u201cSNL,\u201d suggested one skit should play out with \u201c60 Minutes\u201d commentator Andy Rooney finding an empty pill bottle on his desk.\n\u201c\u2019I give the pills to Lesley Stahl.\nThen when Lesley is passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her.\u2019 Or \u2018That\u2019s why you never see Lesley until February.\u2019 Or, \u2018When she passes out.\nI put her in various positions and take pictures of her,\u2019\u201d Franken was quoted saying.\nThe article, along with a 2000 Playboy column in which Franken talked about fantasizing a machine would perform oral sex on him, was used to attack Franken during his 2008 Senate campaign in Minnesota.\nAs much as we may be appalled by some of the things that Al Franken has done, the truth is that there are far worse offenders in Washington.\nLet\u2019s talk about Bill Clinton for a moment.\nDemocrats have been covering up his sexual crimes for years, and my hope is that now this will start to change.\nJuanita Broaddrick, Kathleen Willey, Connie Hamzy, Eileen Wellstone, Sandra Allen James, Christy Zercher, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky, Gennifer Flowers, Elizabeth Ward Gracen, Sally Perdue, Lencola Sullivan, Susie Whitacre and Bobbie Ann William are some of the women that have made allegations against Clinton, and if even half of their allegations are true Clinton should be in prison for the rest of his life.\nIn my article yesterday, I discussed how one Secret Service agent is charging former Vice-President Joe Biden of engaging in \u201cWeinstein-level\u201d behavior, and I also talked about how 15 million dollars in settlements have been secretly paid out to victims of sexual harassment in the House of Representatives in recent years.\nThere is a culture of corruption in Washington D.C., and we desperately need to drain the swamp.\nIf you agree, I hope that you will support my campaign and the campaigns of other anti-establishment candidates that want to clean up the halls of Congress.\nIt is time to take our government back because at this point it has become an absolutely disgusting cesspool of filth and

On Notice\n\nGeert Wilders spoke at a massive rally for Tommy Robinson on Saturday.\n20,000 people came out to call for Tommy\u2019s release, and Wilders took the opportunity to put the political elites of Britain and continental Europe on notice.\n\u201cOur governments,\u201d Wilders declared, \u201csold us out with mass immigration.\nWith Islamization.\nWith open borders.\nWe are almost foreigners in our own lands.\nAnd if we complain about it, they call us racists and Islamophobes.\nBut I say, no more!\nAnd what do you say?\nNo more!\nAnd that\u2019s right: enough is enough.\nWe will not be gagged anymore.\nNo more tyranny.\u201d\nIt was extraordinary that the British authorities allowed Wilders into the country at all.\nSeveral years ago he was banned from entering the country, but although the ban was reversed on appeal, the British government recently banned Martin Sellner, Brittany Pettibone, Lauren Southern and Lutz Bachmann from entering, all for the crime of opposing jihad terror and Sharia oppression, and thereby made it clear that it is more authoritarian and unwilling to uphold the freedom of speech than ever \u2013 at least when it comes to criticism of Islam, Muslim rape gangs, and mass Muslim migration.\nEven worse, the bannings of Sellner, Pettibone, Southern, and Bachmann were just part of a long pattern.\nPamela Geller and I were banned from entering Britain in 2013, apparently for life, also for the crime of telling the truth about Islam and jihad.\nMeanwhile, Britain has a steadily lengthening record of admitting jihad preachers without a moment of hesitation.\nSyed Muzaffar Shah Qadri\u2019s preaching of hatred and jihad violence was so hardline that he was banned from preaching in Pakistan, but the UK Home Office welcomed him into Britain.\nThe UK Home Office also admitted Shaykh Hamza Sodagar into the country, despite the fact that he has said: \u201cIf there\u2019s homosexual men, the punishment is one of five things.\nOne \u2013 the easiest one maybe \u2013 chop their head off, that\u2019s the easiest.\nSecond \u2013 burn them to death.\nThird \u2013 throw \u2019em off a cliff.\nFourth \u2013 tear down a wall on them so they die under that.\nFifth \u2013 a combination of the above.\u201d\nTheresa May\u2019s relentlessly appeasement-minded government also admitted two jihad preachers who had praised the murderer of a foe of Pakistan\u2019s blasphemy laws.\nOne of them was welcomed by the Archbishop of Canterbury.\nMeanwhile, the UK banned three bishops from areas of Iraq and Syria where Christians are persecuted from entering the country.\nBut now matters are coming to a head.\nApparently British authorities decided that it would be too politically costly for them to bar Wilders again.\nAnd so he entered, and spoke, and gave them a strong dose of the reality that they are determined to ignore and deny.\nTommy Robinson is in prison today because he violated a court order demanding that he not film videos outside the trials of Muslim rape gangs.\nClearly the government\u2019s intent was to make sure that as few people as possible discovered the truth about its massive, years-long cover-up of those rape gangs, and refusal to prosecute the perpetrators.\nTheresa May and company obvious hope that other Britons who are furious about the sacrifice of thousands of British girls to the idols of \u201cdiversity\u201d and \u201cmulticulturalism\u201d will see what happened to Tommy, and be frightened into silence.\nThe British government, in imprisoning Tommy Robinson, has shown itself willing to incarcerate people for having opinions that it considers unacceptable.\nThat heralds the death of Britain as a free society and the beginning of an authoritarian police state there, unless this slide to totalitarianism is stopped now.\nBritish public figures, whatever criticism they have leveled against Tommy Robinson in the past, should be calling for him to be freed today, or else they will be exposing themselves as supporting the degeneration of Britain into a police state.\nWilders addressed this endeavor head-on, declaring: \u201cWe will not be silenced.\nWe will not be intimidated.\nAnd we tell the governments, we are not afraid of you.\nWe will never surrender.\nWe will stand strong and do our duty.\nWe will defend our civilization.\nAnd we will protect our people.\u201d\nWilders added: \u201cAnd I tell you, to the governments.\nYou can throw us in jail, but you will never defeat us.\nBecause, my friends, for every Tommy whom you imprison, thousands will rise up.\nSo take notice, Theresa May.\nTake notice, Dutch Prime Minister Rutte.\nTake notice, Mrs. Merkel or President Macron.\nTake notice: the future is ours and not yours.\nWe will defeat you politically, because we, my friends, we are the people.\u201d\nIf Wilders\u2019 words don\u2019t prove true, it will be because the death of free societies in Britain and Western Europe is truly at hand.\n[Photo by Jan Kranendonk]"}

Naval Provocations in Arabian Gulf\n\nYesterday\u2019s State of the Union address issued by Donald Trump represented a refreshing break from the eight years of pusillanimous foreign policies pursued by past administration.\nNowhere was this more evident than in the manner in which Trump described Iran\u2019s repressive regime and attempts by the Iranian people to overthrow it through peaceful protest.\nWhen it comes to Iran\u2019s governing authorities, the Trump administration is under no illusions about the nefarious nature of this fascist theocracy.\n\u201cWe are restoring clarity about our adversaries,\u201d Trump stated in a not too subtle jibe at his predecessor who seemed to be in a perpetual state of confusion about who his friends and enemies were.\nTrump also referenced the recent widespread Iranian protests, crushed with extreme ruthlessness by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Basij auxiliary militia.\n\u201cWhen the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of a corrupt dictatorship,\u201d he stated, \u201cI did not stay silent.\nAmerica stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom.\u201d\nBy contrast, Barack Obama and his obsequious acolytes were besotted by the prospect of forging d\u00e9tente with the despotic mullahs of the Islamic Republic.\nHis administration remained largely silent when Iranians took to the streets in 2009 to protest a rigged election.\nSome have speculated that his administration missed out on a prime opportunity for regime change.\nIt was only downhill from there.\nIn a misguided effort to secure Iran\u2019s willingness to sign the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, Obama sold everything including the kitchen sink.\nHe tried selling the American people on the na\u00efve notion that there were moderate elements of import in the Iranian government, ignoring the obvious fact that all authority in Iran is vested with the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and his IRGC henchmen.\nThe tried and true concept of peace through strength gave way to fecklessness through appeasement.\nRansom payments to the tune of $1.7 billion were transferred to Iran.\nPromising criminal investigations targeting Iran\u2019s chief terror proxy, Hezbollah, were shut down.\nTargeted liquidation operations by our Israeli allies against Iranian Quds Force leaders were foiled after Obama tipped off Tehran on Israel\u2019s intentions.\nIranian material breaches of the JCPOA were all but ignored while Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program was allowed to proceed at full speed despite being in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolution 2231.\nObama\u2019s near messianic zealotry in his interactions with the mullahs severely compromised America\u2019s national security and weakened its image on the international stage.\nWorse, it emboldened the mullahs (appeasement tends to do that) who seemed to revel in Obama\u2019s groveling.\nIran\u2019s mischief-making extends far and wide but it is in the Arabian Gulf where friction between the IRGC and the United States Navy remains constant.\nIran regards the Arabian Gulf as its domain and but for the presence of the U.S. 5th Fleet, would have full reign over its waters, which include the strategic Strait of Hormuz.\nIn addition to securing the Gulf, the 5th Fleet serves as a constant reminder to the Iranians of their impotence.\nBut the deterrent effect of the Navy\u2019s 5th Fleet, and for that matter America\u2019s military might, is only as effective as the political leadership that commands it, and Barack Obama as Commander in Chief of the armed forces did little to instill fear or project deterrence.\nOn the contrary, the Iranians correctly viewed him as weak, indecisive and ineffectual.\nOn his watch, American warships patrolling the Gulf were harried by armed IRGC speed boats and larger navy frigates with near impunity.\nAt times Iranian naval vessels closed to within 600 to 150 yards of American warships.\nThe navy termed these near ritualistic, belligerent encounters, \u201cunsafe and unprofessional.\u201d\nIranian arrogance and impudence reached its zenith with the January 12th 2016 seizure of two American riverine command boats and their crews near Farsi Island.\nThe RCBs and crews manning them were returned some 16 hours later but not before the Iranians stole two satellite phone sim cards, likely containing classified information, as well as thousands of pages of information downloaded from laptops, GPS devices and maps used by the sailors.\nIronically, the seizure occurred on the very day that Obama was to give his State of the Union address but predictably, he didn\u2019t think that the seizure of Americans was important enough to note.\nBut according to the Navy, the past five months have witnessed markedly less belligerent conduct from the Iranians, leaving Navy officials baffled by the sudden positive change in attitude.\nIn fact, Iran\u2019s attitude adjustment in the Arabian Gulf is no mystery and stems from the Trump administration\u2019s implementation of a new robust foreign policy vis-\u00e0-vis the Islamic Republic.\nSoon after taking office, Trump noted that \u201cIran [was] playing with fire\u201d and added that he wouldn\u2019t be as \u201ckind\u201d to the mullahs as Obama was.\nThis wasn\u2019t empty rhetoric.\nIt was backed up by tangible action.\nAdditional sanctions were imposed against Iran for acting in defiance of UNSCR 2231.\nSanctions were also imposed against the IRGC for supporting terrorism.\nTrump\u2019s DOJ revived and breathed new life into Project Cassandra, a promising anti-Hezbollah/IRGC law enforcement initiative shelved by Obama.\nMost importantly, Trump failed to certify the JCPOA noting material Iranian breaches, and has threatened to abrogate the deal in its entirety unless modifications are implemented.\nThose modifications would include an end to absurd sunset clauses in the JCPOA and tough restrictions on ballistic missile testing.\nThe mullahs have become cognizant of the fact that there\u2019s a new sheriff in town, one that backs up tough talk with action and doesn\u2019t ask \u201chow high\u201d when they say \u201cjump.\u201d Clearly, the IRGC\u2019s new docile posture in the Arabian Gulf is a direct consequence of this realization."}

unfortunate that law enforcement begin to immediately criminalize the victim\u2014in this case, someone who was clearly was the victim that has absolutely no bearing on the fact that he was shot in his home,\u201d Merritt added to Fox 4.\nPointing out the glaring nature of the smear campaign was the fact that there has been absolutely zero information released about the warrants conducted on officer Amber Guyger, the killer cop who lived just below Jean.\n\u201cI would love to see more information coming out about the warrants executed on the home of the shooter who lived just below him.\nI haven\u2019t seen any of those,\u201d said Merritt.\nMerritt accused the department of conducting a \u201ccommon assassination attempt on the victim that we often see in law enforcement involved shootings.\u201d Sadly, he appears to be correct in his accusations.\nIt is standard procedure for police to dig up dirt on their victims in attempts to smear and assassinate their character to make the killer cops look good in the public eye.\nEven sadder, however, is the fact that these smear campaigns work most of the time.\nAs the Free Thought Project reported on Wednesday, according to police \u2014 who continue to attempt to spin this story into some tragic mistake \u2014 Guyger accidentally went into the wrong apartment, mistook Jean for an intruder and killed him.\n\u201cGuyger entered the building and walked down the fourth-floor hallway to what she thought was her apartment,\u201d according to the arrest warrant made public Monday afternoon.\n\u201cShe inserted a unique door key, with an electronic chip, into the door keyhole.\nThe door, which was slightly ajar prior to Guyger\u2019s arrival, fully opened under the force of the key insertion.\u201d\n\u201cGuyger drew her firearm, gave verbal commands that were ignored by \u2026 Jean,\u201d according to the warrant.\n\u201cGuyger fired her handgun two times striking [Jean] in the torso.\nGuyger entered the apartment, immediately called 911, requesting police and EMS, and provided first aid to \u2026 Jean.\n\u201cDue to the interior darkness of the apartment, Guyger turned on the interior lights while on the phone with 911.\nUpon being asked where she was located by emergency dispatchers, Guyger returned to the front door to observe the address and discovered she was at the wrong apartment,\u201d according to the arrest warrant.\nAt no time, according to the warrant, does Guyger say what \u201cverbal commands\u201d she gave.\nWhat\u2019s more, any verbal commands she did give were entirely irrelevant as she was the intruder\u2014not Jean.\nAttempting to imply that Jean was somehow at fault for his own death for disobeying the commands of a homicidal cop who\u2019d just illegally broken into his home is as irresponsible as it is reprehensible.\nWhat\u2019s more, according to the attorneys for Jean, when Guyger was on the phone with police, she had to go outside to verify the address of the apartment\u2014implying that she knew she was in the wrong apartment from the start.\n\u201cFrom the fact that when you look at an affidavit and I\u2019m thinking that I\u2019m at my house and I call 911 because someone was just shot,\u201d Attorney Daryl Washington said.\n\u201cWell, the very first thing that I\u2019m going to do is I\u2019m not going to go outside and look at my address?\nI\u2019m going to give them my address right there on the phone.\nI\u2019m going to say I\u2019m on the phone.\nMy address is this.\nWhy did she have to go outside to verify the address?\nIt makes no sense whatsoever.\u201d\nEven more ominous than having to verify the address is the fact that according to witnesses, Guyger\u2019s story of inserting the key into Jean\u2019s door and it opening up was simply not true.\nAccording to witnesses, Guyger was banging on Jean\u2019s door, demanding he let her in.\n\u201cIndependent witnesses have already come forward to say that they heard this officer pounding on the door and demanding to be let in,\u201d Lee Merritt, one of the attorneys representing the Jean family, told ABC News.\n\u201cThe contradictions begin to build from there.\u201d\nThe doors in the complex are also equipped with an automatic closing mechanism.\nThis was demonstrated by the attorneys who opened the door and released it several times\u2014showing that it closed every single time\u2014blowing the claim that the door was somehow ajar completely out of the water.\nJean\u2019s family also pointed out that it would have been incredibly unlikely for Guyger to mistake Jean\u2019s apartment for her own as he had a distinct red door mat which would have been enough for the cop to know she was at the wrong place.\nThe hallway

{"dataset": "propaganda-techniques", "split": "test", "setup_id": "propaganda-techniques", "example_idx": 93, "metadata": {"article": "698503276"}, "output": "Kerry On Edge As Legacy Crumbles\n\nFormer Secretary of State John Kerry wasted no time condemning President Trump\u2019s decision not to recertify, and to possibly withdraw from, the disastrous nuclear deal with Iran that Kerry negotiated on behalf of his boss Barack Obama.\nPresident Trump insisted on significant improvements to the Joint Plan of Comprehensive Action (JCPOA), as the deal is formally known.\nThe JCPOA\u2019s fundamental flaws that President Trump wants fixed include Iran\u2019s ability to block unfettered international inspections, the wiggle room that Iran is exploiting to continue developing and testing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons, and the sunset clause on nuclear enrichment that would provide Iran a clear path to becoming a nuclear armed state after the current restrictions are lifted.\nObama and Kerry had promised that these issues would be dealt with satisfactorily before agreeing to the final terms of the JCPOA.\nInstead they caved to Iranian pressure in order to get the deal done.\nNow that President Trump is trying to clean up the mess Obama and Kerry left him, Kerry has the gall to label President Trump\u2019s decision a \"reckless abandonment of facts in favor of ego and ideology\" and to accuse the Trump administration of \u201clying to the American people.\u201d It was the Obama administration that recklessly abandoned the facts in pressing ahead with the deal.\nThe Obama administration lied to the American people, abandoning its own promises to ensure that the deal contained ironclad protections.\nMoreover, all that President Trump has done so far is to return the JCPOA to Congress for review.\nHad Obama followed the Constitution and submitted the JCPOA to the Senate as a treaty in the first place, the JCPOA in its present form almost certainly would not have been approved.\nCongress should now have the opportunity to revisit the JCPOA to determine whether the protections that the Obama administration promised are working as advertised.\nCongress should also consider whether time limits on Iran\u2019s commitments continue to make sense in light of what we are now experiencing with Iran\u2019s nuclear technology collaborator, North Korea.\nIt bought time to turn into a full-fledged nuclear power under our noses.\nKerry had promised that the Iranian regime would be prohibited from testing ballistic missiles.\nThis turned out to be a lie.\nAfter the JCPOA was finalized, with no such prohibition included, Iran continued to test such missiles.\nThe Obama administration\u2019s response was that the missiles had become a separate issue, to be dealt with under a new United Nations Security Council resolution endorsing the JCPOA.\nThe new resolution replaced clear prohibitions imposed on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile program with a weak declaration in an annex that simply \u201ccalls upon\u201d Iran not to undertake any activity such as development and test launches related to ballistic missiles designed to be capable of delivering nuclear weapons for eight years.\nIran has tested several ballistic missiles during the last two years, including two Qadr H missiles with the phrase \u201cIsrael must be wiped out\u201d emblazoned on the sides.\nThe commander of Iran\u2019s Army, Major General Ataollah Salehi, had told reporters just a month before the launch of those missiles that Iran was \"neither paying any attention to the resolutions against Iran, nor implementing them.\nThis is not a breach of the JCPOA.\u201d\nRussian Ambassador to the United Nations Vitaly Churkin, spurning requests from Obama administration officials to impose sanctions against Iran under the Security Council resolution, asserted that the Iranian missile test did not violate the resolution.\n\u201cA call is different from a ban so legally you cannot violate a call, you can comply with a call or you can ignore the call, but you cannot violate a call,\u201d the Russian ambassador said.\nIn short, the JCPOA did not cover the missile tests and the replacement UN Security Council resolution that did mention the missiles is toothless.\nDeputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes told CNN, during an interview aired on April 6, 2015, that under the deal\u2019s terms then still being negotiated, \u201cyou will have anywhere, anytime, 24/7 access as it relates to the nuclear facilities that Iran has.\"\nRhodes claimed that \u201cif we see a site that we need to inspect on a military facility, we can get access to that site and inspect it.\nSo if it's a suspicious site that we believe is related to its nuclear efforts, we can get access and inspect that site through the IAEA.\u201d This was another lie.\nAfter the JCPOA was finalized in July 2015, Rhodes shamelessly denied that anytime, anywhere inspections were ever considered as part of the negotiations.\n\u201cWe never sought in this negotiation the capacity for so-called anytime, anywhere,\u201d Rhodes said on July 14, 2015.\nThe JCPOA\u2019s supporters, including Kerry, have made much of the fact that the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has on several occasions verified Iran\u2019s compliance with its commitments under the JCPOA, keeping its stock of low-enriched uranium below the limit set forth in the JCPOA and not pursuing further construction of the Arak reactor.\nIran was found to have slightly exceeded the limit on its stock of heavy water, but has remedied the problem to the IAEA\u2019s satisfaction.\nIAEA chief Yukiya Amano reiterated in a statement he issued on October 9th that Iran has remained in compliance with its JCPOA commitments.\nThe problem, as any clear-eyed observer of the process recognizes, is that the IAEA relies on Iran for self-inspection of certain sites that the regime does not want the IAEA to inspect freely on its own.\nIAEA inspectors have avoided examining military sites it knows exists and has no reliable way of tracking undeclared sites.\nThe IAEA\u2019s explanation for not visiting any of Iran\u2019s known military sites is that it had \u201cno reason to ask\u201d for access.\nEvidently, the IAEA is supposed to block out the fact that Iran had conducted tests relevant to nuclear bomb detonations at a military site before the JCPOA\u2019s finalization in 2015.\nThe IAEA should just pretend that such tests could not possibly happen again.\n\u201cNobody is allowed to visit Iran's military sites,\u201d said Iran\u2019s Head of Strategic Research Center at the Expediency Council and adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, Ali Akbar Velayati.\nIntimidation works.\nThe IAEA knows not to ask.\nAs to the JCPOA\u2019s sunset provisions, the Obama administration lied about that too.\nKerry claimed on September 2, 2015 that the JCPOA \u201cnever sunsets.\nThere\u2019s no sunset in this agreement.\u201d\nThis month Kerry has resorted to parsing words.\nHe claims the phrase 'sunset provisions' is a \u201cmisnomer,\u201d before then defending the JCPOA\u2019s time limits.\n\"We were comfortable because the cap on Iran\u2019s low-enriched uranium stockpile remains in place until 2030,\u201d Kerry wrote in an article published in the Washington Post late last month.\nIn other words, let\u2019s just kick the can down the road and hope for a more reasonable Iranian regime in 13 years that would agree to extend the time limits.\nIn the meantime, Kerry advises us not to worry.\nKerry declared, \u201c15 or 25 years from now, we still have the same military options we have today.\u201d\nJohn Kerry has obviously learned nothing from the North Korean fiasco, which resulted from years of phony agreements with the rogue regime and so-called \u201cstrategic patience.\u201d The United States clearly does not have the same military options today to deal with a nuclear armed North Korea as it did 23 years ago when former President Bill Clinton decided not to use military force to stamp out North Korea\u2019s nuclear program at its inception.\nInstead, Clinton started us down the primrose path of na\u00efve diplomacy with a duplicitous regime that now is on the verge of being able to strike the U.S. mainland with nuclear warheads delivered by intercontinental ballistic missiles.\nIt is precisely because North Korea\u2019s actions over the last 23 years have proven that making concessions to a rogue regime in order to obtain denuclearization commitments is so dangerous that President Trump does not want to make the same mistake with Iran.\nAmerica\u2019s European allies are also upset with President Trump for refusing to recertify the deal and threatening to pull out if certain conditions are not met.\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a joint statement last Friday praising the JCPOA and its implementation.\nThey said that the nuclear deal with Iran was \u201cthe culmination of 13 years of diplomacy and was a major step towards ensuring that Iran\u2019s nuclear programme is not diverted for military purposes.\nTherefore, we encourage the US Administration and Congress to consider the implications to the security of the US and its allies before taking any steps that might undermine the JCPOA, such as re-imposing sanctions on Iran lifted under the agreement.\u201d\nPerhaps these European leaders should remember their own history.\nAppeasement through phony deals with a rogue dictatorship does not work, as proven by the infamous Munich Pact signed by British and French Prime Ministers Neville Chamberlain and Edouard Daladier with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler seventy-nine years ago."}

Barack Obama (D) and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan that he took in 2005 at a Congressional Black Caucus meeting, but did not make public because he believed it would have \u201cmade a difference\u201d to Obama\u2019s political future.\nThe photographer, Askia Muhammad, told the Trice Edney News Wire that he \u201cgave the picture up at the time and basically swore secrecy.\u201d \u201cBut after the nomination was secured and all the way up until the inauguration; then for eight years after he was President, it was kept under cover,\u201d Muhammad said.\nAsked whether he thought the photo\u2019s release would have affected Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, Muhammad said, \u201cI insist.\nIt absolutely would have made a difference.\u201d Reached by TPM on Thursday, Muhammad said a \u201cstaff member\u201d for the CBC contacted him \u201csort of in a panic\u201d after he took the photo at a caucus meeting in 2005.\nTPM has published the photo above with Muhammad\u2019s permission.\n\u201cI sort of understood what was going on,\u201d Muhammad told TPM.\n\u201cI promised and made arrangements to give the picture to Leonard Farrakhan,\u201d the minister\u2019s son-in-law and chief of staff.\nMuhammad said he gave away \u201cthe disk\u201d from his camera but \u201ccopied the photograph from that day onto a file\u201d on his computer.\n\u201cRealizing that I had given it up, I mean, it was sort of like a promise to keep the photograph secret,\u201d Muhammad said.\nMuhammad said he did not release his copy of the photograph because he thought it would be perceived as a betrayal of that promise: \u201cI was really, I guess, afraid of them.\u201d\nMalcolm X wasn\u2019t adequately afraid of them.\nHere\u2019s what happened to him:\nhttps://youtu.be/qSm1t3Uv9QI\nMuhammad said he thought the photograph would be \u201cdamaging politically\u201d if it were released and was afraid that someone might \u201cbreak into his apartment\u201d looking for it, like \u201cthat Watergate crap.\u201d He said he \u201cfelt a little bit more at ease\u201d after Farrakhan in 2016 claimed that Obama visited his home in Chicago.\nMuhammad contacted Farrakhan in autumn 2017 with the \u201cfinal manuscript\u201d for a self-published book containing the photo.\n\u201cI sent him a copy of the manuscript suggesting that, showing him the picture, and saying to him, if he did not object, I was going to publish it,\u201d Muhammad said.\n\u201cHe had no objection.\u201d \u2026 During Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, conservatives pushed multiple apparently racially motivated conspiracy theories about Obama\u2019s religion and supposed ties to Islam.\nFor example, in Obama\u2019s memoir subtitled A Story of Race and Inheritance, Obama recounts his being a regular reader of Minister Farrakhan\u2019s Nation of Islam newspaper The Final Call.\nObama recollects Farrakhan\u2019s black nationalist capitalist campaign to get black people to use toothpaste manufactured by black-owned businesses.\nFarrakhan\u2019s eventual failure suggests to Obama that\u2019s there is more economic upside for blacks in shaking down white institutions than in building their own.\nDuring the 2008 presidential election, conservatives questioned the indirect ties between Farrakhan and Obama, who attended a church that gave Farrakhan an award.\nObama\u2019s \u201cspiritual advisor\u201d Rev.\nJeremiah Wright gave Farrakhan his church\u2019s Lifetime Achievement award in a downtown Chicago Hyatt Regency in November 2007, but the story didn\u2019t make the press until the following year.\nSimilarly, very little media attention was paid to the close relationship between Obama\u2019s fundraiser and private mentor Tony Rezko and the Nation of Islam, even though Rezko\u2019s role was business manager for Nation of Islam assets, such as the career of Muhammad Ali.\nBut after all, what could be more boring than a story than involves a Presidential candidate, the Syrian Christian crook who helped him buy his house, the Nation of Islam, and the most famous boxer of all time?\nReading Obama\u2019s 1995 memoir, you might almost get the impression that after a prudent first term, during his second he might side with, I dunno, Black Lives Matter and encourage a wave of black rage and police retreat that drove up the death toll from murder by 20% in his last two years in office, an incremental death toll a little bigger than the U.S. combat death toll from the equally stupid Iraq War."}
