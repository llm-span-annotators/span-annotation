Let me go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, the title mentions \"More UK Sharia\" which immediately sets a tone implying that Sharia law is taking over the UK. That's loaded language because it uses \"Sharia\" in a way that might evoke fear or prejudice towards Muslims.\n\nThe article starts with \"No one can say this is not what this is.\" That feels like a thought-terminating cliché, discouraging critical thinking by implying the situation is obvious without allowing for other interpretations.\n\nThen it states, \"The Sharia is being implemented in the UK and Muslims are ready to seek total control.\" This is an appeal to fear and prejudice, making it seem like Muslims are a threat. That's Appeal_to_fear-prejudice.\n\nNext, the firefighter was suspended for supporting Tommy Robinson. The article frames this as evidence of Sharia implementation, which oversimplifies the situation by blaming it on Muslims without considering other factors. So that's Causal_Oversimplification.\n\nThe text mentions Tommy Robinson being arrested and sentenced quickly, denied due process. It portrays him as a hero exposing criminal elements in Islam. This is Name_Calling or Labeling because it labels Muslims negatively and presents Robinson as a hero without balanced context.\n\nThere are multiple instances of Loaded_Language throughout, like \"criminal elements in Islam,\" which has strong negative connotations.\n\nThe article also uses Exaggeration by saying the UK is descending into tyranny, comparing it to North Korea and Saudi Arabia. That's hyperbolic and meant to alarm readers.\n\nRepetition of phrases like \"Free Tommy Robinson\" and \"Free Tommy now!\" is clear Repetition, drumming the message in.\n\nFinally, the call to protest with Geert Wilders joining is a Slogan, using a brief phrase to rally support emotionally.", "annotator_group": 0}

The user has provided a text about a rescue operation in New Mexico and wants me to identify spans of text that employ propaganda techniques. They also want the output as a JSON object with specific annotations.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each propaganda technique entails. There are 18 types listed, from Appeal_to_Authority to Whataboutism. Each has examples, so I should refer to those when analyzing the text.\n\nLooking at the provided text, it's about authorities rescuing children from a compound run by Muslim extremists. The language used seems quite descriptive and emotive in parts. My goal is to go through each sentence and see if any of the propaganda techniques apply.\n\nStarting with the first paragraph: \"Eleven children were rescued...\" It mentions \"Muslim Extremist-Run Compound.\" That might be using Loaded Language because it's emotionally charged, associating extremism with Muslims, which could evoke fear or prejudice. So that's a possible annotation for technique 8.\n\nNext, the text describes the living conditions as \"deplorable\" and quotes Sheriff Hogrefe saying it's the \"saddest... I have seen.\" This seems like Exaggeration/Minimisation because it's emphasizing the poor conditions to evoke strong emotions. That would fall under technique 6.\n\nThen, it mentions that only a few potatoes and a box of rice were found. Again, this is highlighting the scarcity, which might be another instance of Exaggeration/Minimisation (technique 6).\n\nThe text refers to Siraj Wahhaj as \"heavily armed\" with specific weapons. This could be Appeal_to_fear-prejudice (technique 1) because it's using details about weaponry to instill fear, especially in the context of extremism.\n\nWhen discussing the surveillance and the message about starving, the text uses direct quotes from Hogrefe. While this is factual, the emotional impact of starvation might still serve to build a narrative that could be propaganda, but I'm not sure if it fits any specific technique beyond what's already noted.\n\nI also need to ensure that each annotation includes \"reason,\" \"text,\" and \"annotation_type.\" Each identified span should be a separate object in the JSON array.\n\nWait, did I miss any other techniques? Let me go through again. The text doesn't seem to use Bandwagon or Straw Men. There's no appeal to authority without evidence, so technique 0 isn't applicable here. It also doesn't use slogans or repetition, so techniques 13 and 14 are out.\n\nI think the main ones are Loaded Language (8), Exaggeration/Minimisation (6) used twice, and Appeal_to_fear-prejudice (1). Each of these instances should be annotated separately with their respective reasons and text spans.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, the title mentions a conspiracy involving Obama, Farrakhan, and the Nation of Islam hiding photos since 2008. That already sounds like it's trying to create fear or suspicion about Obama.\n\nLooking at the first paragraph, it talks about the \"left-wing enemedia\" covering up Obama's connections to jihad and violent left-wing groups while attacking Trump. Using terms like \"enemedia\" is loaded language, which is meant to evoke a negative emotional response towards the media. So that's Loaded_Language (8).\n\nNext, the text mentions the LA Times refusing to release a video of an event with Rashid Khalidi, who is described as antisemitic. This seems to be doubting Obama's character by association without providing evidence, which fits Doubt (5). It's questioning his credibility indirectly.\n\nThen it talks about Obama’s relationship with Reverend Wright, blaming the US for 9/11. Again, this is guilt by association and trying to cast doubt on Obama's judgment, so another instance of Doubt (5).\n\nThe author references their own book, which was ignored by mainstream media. This could be an Appeal_to_Authority (0) since they're citing themselves as a credible source without external validation.\n\nMoving on, the photographer Askia Muhammad is said to have conspired with the Nation of Islam to hide the photo. The text labels the Nation of Islam as a \"terror group,\" which is a strong label meant to fear-monger. That's Appeal_to_fear-prejudice (1).\n\nThe quotes from Farrakhan are included, which include hateful and extreme statements. By associating Obama with Farrakhan through these quotes, it's another attempt to cast doubt on Obama's character, so Doubt (5) again.\n\nThe article mentions that the photographer believed releasing the photo would affect Obama’s campaign. This is implying a hidden truth that could have changed the election, which plays into fear and suspicion, so Appeal_to_fear-prejudice (1).\n\nThroughout the text, terms like \"jihad,\" \"antisemite,\" and \"terror group\" are used repeatedly. These are emotionally charged words meant to instill fear or prejudice, which is Loaded_Language (8).\n\nThe overall narrative presents Obama in a negative light by associating him with controversial figures without substantial evidence, which is Guilt_by_Association, but looking at the list, it's covered under Doubt (5) and Appeal_to_fear-prejudice (1).\n\nI think I've identified several instances of Loaded_Language, Appeal_to_fear-prejudice, and Doubt.

This seems like an Appeal to Fear or Prejudice (type 1).\n\nNext, the text mentions Reid Wilson from The Hill, citing his data on settlements. Using a credible source might be an Appeal to Authority (type 0), but since it's factual and not just taking his opinion as the sole evidence, maybe it's more informative than propagandistic.\n\nThe total amount of $17 million is presented as \"a grand total,\" which could be Exaggeration or Minimisation (type 6). It emphasizes the largeness to provoke a stronger reaction.\n\nThe statement that taxpayers' money funds these settlements directly implicates readers, making them feel personally affected. This could be another Appeal to Fear (type 1) by instilling anxiety about their finances being misused.\n\nWhen the author expresses surprise at over 200 cases, it's a form of Exaggeration (type 6), highlighting the number to emphasize the severity beyond initial expectations.\n\nThe suggestion that leaders should make cases public and hold members accountable is a valid point, but the following claim that they don't want it to stop implies malicious intent. This could be Doubt (type 5) by questioning their credibility.\n\nThe quote about men having no self-control around young women uses Loaded Language (type 8) with emotional terms like \"no self-control\" and \"sex trade,\" which evoke strong negative emotions.\n\nReferring to the situation as a \"sex trade on Capitol Hill\" is more Loaded Language (type 8), using provocative language to condemn the actions without objective discussion.\n\nThe call to action, asking readers to support the campaign and other candidates, uses Bandwagon technique (type 2) by implying that many are already joining this movement.\n\nThe phrase \"grassroots deplorables\" is Name-Calling or Labeling (type 9), using a term with negative connotations to describe opponents.\n\nEmphasizing morality and the need to drain the swamp taps into patriotic feelings, which could be Flag-Waving (type 7) by appealing to national pride and the desire for change.\n\nFinally, demanding Congress release details is a call for transparency, but the way it's framed might also use Loaded Language (type 8) to maintain emotional engagement.", "annotator_group": 0}

That's a strong label, maybe Name-Calling or Labeling since it's assigning a negative trait to the group.\n\nIn the first paragraph, Amber Guyger is described as someone who admitted to shooting Botham Jean for no reason. The article claims she's treated more like a victim than a killer because of \"blue privilege.\" This seems to be using Appeal_to_fear-prejudice by instilling fear or mistrust towards police, implying they're above the law.\n\nNext, it mentions that her apartment wasn't searched and she was allowed to leave without a search. The article suggests this was intentional to help her get away with it. That's Causal_Oversimplification because it assumes a single intent behind the police's actions without considering other possibilities.\n\nThen, Botham Jean's house was searched, and they found marijuana to smear his name. This is Loaded_Language because using \"smear\" has a negative connotation, implying unfair treatment.\n\nThe article states that Guyger received special treatment, not being searched, turning herself in at convenience, and getting out quickly. It compares her to rich people with lawyers, which might be an Exaggeration or Minimisation since it's making the situation seem more extreme than it is.\n\nShe was charged with manslaughter instead of murder, which could lead to a shorter sentence. This is another point where the article is highlighting unfair treatment, possibly using Appeal_to_fear-prejudice again by making readers anxious about the justice system.\n\nProtesters were arrested for obstructing traffic after a ceremony and are still in jail while Guyger is free. The attorney's tweet mentions they've spent more time in jail than the officer.

It might be an example of obfuscation because it's not clearly explaining what exactly she did wrong beyond being arrested.\n\nThen there's a poll asking who should replace Nikki Haley, which seems unrelated to the main story. This could be a red herring, diverting attention from the article's focus on Guyger's firing.\n\nThe article mentions that Guyger can appeal her firing under civil service rules and notes that Chief Hall had previously refused to fire her, citing ongoing investigations.

This might be causal oversimplification because it simplifies the legal complexities into a sudden change without explaining the specifics.\n\nThe part where Dana Loesch from the NRA responds with \"Good\" and her earlier controversial comment about Botham Jean possibly being alive if he owned a gun could be an appeal to authority, using her status as an NRA spokesperson to influence opinion. However, since she's not an expert on legal procedures or police conduct, it might also be testimonial fallacy.\n\nThe article then contrasts Guyger's case with another where a man shot officers entering his apartment and wasn't arrested, which the police chief praised. This comparison could be using the bandwagon technique by implying that because others (like this father) were treated leniently, similar actions should be accepted or expected elsewhere.\n\nFinally, the article ends with the Jean family's attorney expressing satisfaction and seeking further legal action. The use of \"satisfaction\" might be loaded language to sway reader emotions towards supporting the family's cause.\n\nSo, I think there are several propaganda techniques here: loaded language in the first paragraph, obfuscation with \"adverse conduct,\" red herring with the poll, causal oversimplification regarding the legal reasons for firing, appeal to authority/testimonial with Dana Loesch's comment, and bandwagon effect with the comparison case. Each of these needs to be annotated accordingly.", "annotator_group": 0}

The task is to identify spans of text that use propaganda techniques and then output them as a JSON object with specific annotations.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire article carefully to understand the context. It's about an outbreak of the bubonic and pneumonic plague in Madagascar, which has already caused several deaths and is spreading rapidly. The hospitals are on high alert, and officials are taking measures to control it.\n\nNow, I need to look for any propaganda techniques as defined by the 18 categories provided. Let me go through each paragraph step by step.\n\nThe first sentence: \"Madagascar Hospitals On High Alert: ‘No One Is Safe’ From The Black Plague.\" This uses a direct quote from officials stating that no one is safe. That seems like it's trying to instill fear, so maybe Appeal_to_fear-prejudice (type 1).\n\nNext paragraph mentions travelers being warned and doctors warning that \"no one is safe.\" Again, this reinforces the fear element, so another instance of type 1.\n\nThe third paragraph repeats the same quote about no one being safe. That's repetition for emphasis, which could be Repetition (type 13) or maybe Exaggeration/Minimisation if it's overstating the risk, but I think it's more about fear, so probably another type 1.\n\nThen, officials mention that the disease has spread to urban areas not usually affected. This might be an Appeal_to_fear-prejudice again because it's highlighting that even unexpected places are unsafe.\n\nThe article mentions that experts warn this epidemic is \"much more dangerous\" than previous years. Using \"much more dangerous\" could be Loaded Language (type 8) as it's emotionally charged to emphasize severity.\n\nLater, Elhadj As Sy says overcoming the epidemic requires long-term help, not just intervening at the peak. This seems like a genuine statement without propaganda intent.\n\nDr. Rakotoarivony mentions that people from all areas are catching the disease, which is factual and doesn't seem propagandistic.\n\nJimmy Whitworth's quote about it being a long time since the plague was in an urban environment adds context but isn't necessarily propaganda.\n\nThe last part says health officials state no one is safe, including travelers, causing concern over a global pandemic. This again uses fear to emphasize the risk, so another type 1 instance.\n\nI also notice that the phrase \"no one is safe\" is repeated multiple times, which could be Repetition (type 13) as it's used to drive the point home and create urgency.\n\nSo, compiling these observations:\n\n- The headline and several mentions of \"no one is safe\" fall under Appeal_to_fear-prejudice (type 1).\n- The term \"much more dangerous\" uses Loaded Language (type 8).\n- Repetition of \"no one is safe\" is an example of Repetition (type 13).\n\nI need to make sure each identified span is correctly categorized and that the reasons are clear. Also, I should check if any other techniques apply, but from my analysis, these three seem to fit best.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me go through each paragraph step by step.\n\nFirst, the title mentions that police didn't search Amber Guyger’s apartment and now it's too late because she vacated it. That seems like a factual statement, but maybe there's some loaded language or implication of special treatment.\n\nIn the first paragraph, activists are rallying to draw attention to Botham Jean's slaying. They're carrying coffins and blocking traffic. The text says they want to expose the \"special treatment\" of Amber Guyger. Using \"special treatment\" might be loaded language because it implies favoritism without neutral terms. So that could be Loaded_Language (8).\n\nNext, there are details about the search warrants. It mentions that none were for Guyger’s apartment and that she's vacated it. The text points out that police released info from Jean's apartment but not hers. This seems to imply a double standard, maybe using Exaggeration or Minimisation by highlighting the lack of search as a significant oversight.\n\nThe article quotes Attorney Stephen Le Brocq saying the affidavit isn't objective and is based on Guyger’s word. That might be Appeal_to_Authority (0) because it cites an expert opinion to support the claim of bias, but I'm not sure if that's the case here since he's pointing out a lack of objectivity.\n\nThen, the text describes how police released info from Jean's apartment on the day of his burial and tried to \"assassinate his character\" by mentioning weed. The term \"assassinate his character\" is definitely Loaded_Language (8) because it uses strong emotional words to criticize the police action.\n\nThe part where they mention that Guyger has vacated her apartment might be an attempt to show she's avoiding accountability, which could relate to Obfuscation (10) if it's implying something without clear evidence.\n\nTowards the end, Allison Jean says her son's life matters. This is a slogan-like phrase, similar to \"Black Lives Matter,\" so that could be Slogans (14).\n\nI also notice some repetition of the idea that Guyger received special treatment, which might be Repetition (13) to emphasize the point.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I can identify several spans with propaganda techniques.

The judge cites this letter to say his detention violated due process. This seems more like legal reasoning than propaganda.\n\nRombot thanks his supporters outside, which is a neutral statement. The U.S. Attorney's office considering an appeal is also straightforward reporting.\n\nICE officials explain their position, stating the arrangement was temporary and they have discretion. Again, this is presenting both sides without emotional language.\n\nThe article then talks about the Indonesian community in New Hampshire and their fears of returning to a Muslim-majority country. This part might be using loaded language by highlighting \"discrimination or violence,\" which could evoke fear. That's a possible Appeal_to_fear-prejudice (type 1).\n\nIt mentions support from both Republican Governor Sununu and Democratic delegates, showing bipartisan backing without any clear propaganda technique here.\n\nFinally, the judge is considering a longer delay for legal status. No emotional appeals here either.\n\nSo, the only part that stands out is the mention of potential discrimination or violence, which could be using fear to build support.

The article compares him to Brett Kavanaugh, which might be a Red Herring because it diverts attention from Ellison's case by bringing up Kavanaugh's unrelated situation.\n\nIn the first paragraph, Ellison is called an \"abuser\" without proof. That's Name-Calling or Labeling (9), trying to create a negative image of him.\n\nThe article says Ellison hasn't denied accusations in a committee like Kavanaugh did. This could be Appeal to Fear/Prejudice (1) by implying he's hiding something, making readers fear his guilt.\n\nMentioning that at least one woman filed a police report adds credibility, but the comparison to Kavanaugh might be using Appeal to Authority (0), suggesting that because there's a report, it's more valid.\n\nEllison welcomes an investigation, which is presented as him being innocent. This could be Exaggeration or Minimisation (6) by downplaying the allegations' severity.\n\nThe article then criticizes Ellison for not standing before a committee, possibly using Loaded Language (8) with words like \"abuser\" to evoke strong emotions.\n\nLater, it mentions supporters hiring an attorney, implying bias. This could be Doubt (5), questioning the investigation's credibility without evidence.\n\nThe firm's political donations are highlighted, suggesting the investigation isn't independent.

This could be Exaggeration (6), making past issues seem more significant than they are.\n\nIt mentions Ellison's relationship with Monahan and their social media presence, which might be using Loaded Language (8) by emphasizing their closeness to suggest guilt.\n\nThe article quotes a journalist saying the story didn't hold up under scrutiny. This could be Appeal to Authority (0), using a journalist's credibility to dismiss the allegations.\n\nEllison's past includes another misconduct allegation from 2006, which is brought up again. This might be Exaggeration (6) by piling on past issues to tarnish his image now.\n\nThe article suggests Ellison is hiding from reporters, calling him an \"effeminate pansy.\" That's definitely Name-Calling (9), using derogatory terms to demean him.\n\nFinally, it contrasts Ellison with Kavanaugh, implying Ellison isn't as brave.

The article starts by comparing it to Obama's 2004 campaign, where his team unsealed Jack Ryan's records. It uses terms like \"corrupt party\" and \"Democrat machine,\" which might be loaded language or name-calling.\n\nIn the first paragraph after the title, words like \"corrupt party in Chicago\" stand out. That seems to use loaded language because it's adding negative connotations without proof. Also, \"managed to unseal\" could imply something sneaky, so maybe that's another example of loaded language or name-calling.\n\nNext, the article talks about Obama's backers emailing reporters, which led Ryan to resign. The phrase \"different rules for the lawless party\" definitely sounds like it's using loaded language by labeling the Democrats as lawless without evidence. That's a clear case of name-calling or labeling.\n\nMoving on, the Star Tribune is suing to unseal Ellison's records. The article mentions that Alpha News is right-leaning, which might be an attempt to discredit them by association, possibly using appeal to fear/prejudice if it's trying to make readers wary of their bias.\n\nThen there are allegations against Ellison from his ex-girlfriend Karen Monahan. She tweeted about him lying and smearing, which he denies. The article mentions a video she claims to have but hasn't shown, saying it's traumatizing or that she misplaced it. This part might be using doubt by questioning her credibility without solid evidence.\n\nMonahan also released a medical record from 2017 stating she was in an abusive relationship. While this is a fact, the way it's presented could be trying to sway opinion against Ellison without concrete proof, which might relate to appeal to fear or prejudice.\n\nKen Martin says the DFL investigation will soon be finished. The external investigator adds credibility, but if the timing is just before the election, it might be an example of obfuscation or intentional vagueness about the findings.\n\nThe Star Tribune argues that the divorce records are a public concern because Kim Ellison supports her ex-husband publicly. This could be seen as trying to sway voters by bringing up past personal issues, which might be causal oversimplification if they're implying his past behavior dictates his current suitability without evidence.\n\nEllison's campaign responds, saying their divorce isn't the public's business and that it's a political move. The statement itself doesn't use propaganda, but the context of the lawsuit might be an example of using personal attacks to influence the election, which could relate to several techniques like appeal to fear or name-calling.\n\nThroughout the article, terms like \"corrupt,\" \"lawless,\" and focusing on unproven allegations seem to repeatedly use loaded language and name-calling. There's also a bandwagon effect if the media is trying to sway public opinion by highlighting these issues without full context.\n\nI think I've covered most of the potential propaganda techniques here, but I need to make sure each identified span matches one of the 18 categories correctly.", "annotator_group": 0}

Also, saying it's \"much more deadly\" could be exaggeration (type 6).\n\nThe text refers to the Marburg virus as one of the most virulent pathogens with no specific treatment.

It doesn't cite any experts beyond his position, so maybe not this one.\n\n2. **Appeal to Fear/Prejudice**: The author talks about people acting out of emotion and fear regarding North Korea and jihadis. This seems like it's using fear to justify opposition, so that's a possible match for technique 1.\n\n3. **Bandwagon Effect**: I don't see any mention of majority opinion or everyone else doing something, so probably not here.\n\n4. **Black-and-White Fallacy**: The text presents two options (regime change vs. diplomacy) but doesn't explicitly limit it to only those two, so maybe not.\n\n5. **Causal Oversimplification**: The author suggests that regime changes don't work out well because of US involvement. This oversimplifies the causes, ignoring other factors, which fits technique 4.\n\n6. **Doubt**: There's skepticism about media reports and CIA claims, but it's more about questioning credibility than casting doubt on someone's position.\n\n7. **Exaggeration/Minimization**: The text uses strong language like \"illegal black ops\" and \"torture,\" which could be exaggerating the severity, fitting technique 6.\n\n8. **Flag-Waving**: The author mentions what America stands for, appealing to patriotism, so that's technique 7.\n\n9. **Loaded Language**: Words like \"illegal,\" \"torture,\" and \"fearful\" have strong emotional connotations, fitting technique 8.\n\n10. **Name-Calling/Labeling**: Not directly labeling individuals but more describing actions, so maybe not this one.\n\n11. **Obfuscation**: The text is clear in its arguments, so no intentional vagueness here.\n\n12. **Red Herring**: No irrelevant material introduced to divert attention.\n\n13. **Reductio ad Hitlerum**: No comparison to hated groups or individuals like Hitler.\n\n14. **Repetition**: The main points about Pompeo and Haspel are repeated but not excessively for persuasion.\n\n15. **Slogans**: No brief, striking phrases used as slogans.\n\n16. **Straw Men**: The author presents Paul's arguments accurately without misrepresenting opposing views.\n\n17. **Thought-Terminating Clichés**: No use of clichés to stop critical thinking.\n\n18. **Whataboutism**: Not deflecting criticism by pointing out others' faults.\n\nSo, the techniques I identified are Appeal to Fear/Prejudice (1), Causal Oversimplification (4), Exaggeration/Minimization (6), Flag-Waving (7), and Loaded Language (8). Each of these is present in specific sentences that use fear, oversimplify causes, exaggerate, appeal to patriotism, or use emotionally charged words.\n\nI need to make sure each annotation includes the reason, text span, and correct type. I'll extract the exact phrases where these techniques are applied and assign them the right indices from 0 to 17 as per the list.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me go through each paragraph step by step.\n\nStarting with the title: \"Dallas Chief Says She Can’t Fire Amber Guyger for Killing Botham Jean - Dept Rules Imply Otherwise.\" Hmm, this seems to present two opposing viewpoints without a middle ground. It's implying either she can't fire her or the dept rules say otherwise, which might be a Black-and-White Fallacy.\n\nIn the first paragraph, it mentions citizens calling for justice and the controversy growing. Not sure about propaganda here yet. The second paragraph talks about a town hall meeting with questions about the arrest delay and why Guyger hasn't been fired. Still more informative than propagandistic.\n\nMoving on, Chief Hall dodges questions but explains she can't fire Guyger due to laws. Then experts say this isn't true. This sets up a conflict where the authority (Chief) is contradicted by other experts, which might relate to Appeal_to_Authority if the article is using the experts' opinions to discredit the Chief without evidence.\n\nThe article then quotes Justin Moore, an attorney, expressing confusion at Hall's comments. Using an expert opinion here could be an Appeal_to_Authority technique because it's citing a civil rights attorney to back up their claim against the Chief.\n\nNext, WFAA is mentioned as pointing out that Dallas Police Department's own orders allow the chief to take action. This seems like a factual statement but might be used to build a case against Hall, possibly using Loaded_Language by emphasizing \"integrity\" not being preserved.\n\nThe article then gives examples of other officers being fired quickly after similar incidents. Comparing Guyger's situation to others could be an Appeal_to_fear-prejudice if it's instilling anxiety about the police department's integrity or fairness.\n\nWhen discussing Amy Wilburn and Cardan Spencer, both were fired after their accounts were proven false. This might be Exaggeration/Minimisation by highlighting these cases to make Guyger's situation seem more egregious by comparison.\n\nThe question posed, \"why hasn’t the chief fired Gugyer...\" is a Doubt technique as it questions Hall's credibility and decision-making without providing her side beyond the initial statement.\n\nThe article mentions that WFAA asked for specific laws but didn't receive them. This could be Obfuscation if the department is being vague about their reasons, though it's more of a factual report here.\n\nFinally, the conclusion states that Guyger is subject to different rules, implying favoritism. This might use Loaded_Language by framing her as being treated specially, evoking negative emotions towards the department.\n\nSo, I think several propaganda techniques are present: Appeal_to_Authority (using experts), Black-and-White Fallacy in the title, Exaggeration/Minimisation with other officers' cases, Doubt when questioning Hall's actions, and Loaded_Language throughout.", "annotator_group": 0}

The user has provided a list of 18 different techniques with examples, so I'll go through each one step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire text carefully to understand the context. It's about Clinton defending his actions during the affair, stating he doesn't owe Lewinsky an apology, and pointing out that some facts were omitted to fit a narrative. He also brings up current allegations against Trump.\n\nLooking at each propaganda technique:\n\n1. **Appeal_to_Authority**: Clinton is a former president, so if he cites another authority figure to back his claims without evidence, that's this. But in the text, he doesn't reference any other experts or authorities beyond himself.\n\n2. **Appeal_to_fear-prejudice**: This would involve instilling fear or using prejudice. Clinton isn't doing that here; he's more on the defensive.\n\n3. **Bandwagon**: He doesn't mention popular opinion or suggest everyone else is agreeing with him, so probably not this.\n\n4. **Black-and-White_Fallacy**: He presents his actions as right without acknowledging other possibilities. When he says \"I did the right thing,\" it's a binary choice, ignoring nuances about power dynamics Lewinsky mentions. That fits.\n\n5. **Causal_Oversimplification**: He attributes criticism to frustration over Trump's allegations, simplifying the reasons for the omitted facts. This seems like oversimplification because there could be multiple reasons beyond just that.\n\n6. **Doubt**: Questioning credibility. Clinton doesn't directly question Lewinsky's credibility here; he focuses on his own actions and public apologies.\n\n7. **Exaggeration/Minimisation**: He downplays the need for a direct apology by emphasizing public sorries, which might be minimizing the personal impact on Lewinsky.\n\n8. **Flag-Waving**: Using patriotism or group identity. Not applicable here as there's no mention of national pride or similar themes.\n\n9. **Loaded_Language**: Emotional words. Clinton uses \"conveniently omitted\" and \"frustrated,\" which have negative connotations, possibly to sway opinion against his critics.\n\n10. **Name_Calling/Labeling**: He doesn't label anyone with pejorative terms in this text.\n\n11. **Obfuscation/Vagueness**: His statement about facts being omitted is vague without specifics, making it hard to verify or dispute.\n\n12. **Red_Herring**: He brings up Trump's allegations, which might divert attention from his own actions. This fits as a distraction.\n\n13. **Reductio_ad_hitlerum**: No comparison to disliked groups here.\n\n14. **Repetition**: Not evident in the provided text.\n\n15. **Slogans**: No brief, catchy phrases used.\n\n16. **Straw_Men**: He doesn't misrepresent Lewinsky's arguments; instead, he addresses her points about consent and power dynamics directly.\n\n17. **Thought-terminating_Cliches**: Phrases like \"I did the right thing\" could be seen as stopping further discussion on the matter.\n\n18. **Whataboutism**: By pointing to Trump's situation, Clinton diverts attention from his own actions, which is a classic example of this technique.\n\nSo, I'll identify each applicable span and map them to their respective techniques with justifications.", "annotator_group": 0}

That seems like it's trying to link her to negative events without direct evidence, which might be Guilt by Association.\n\nThe first sentence says the left made Linda into a role model and \"climbed into bed with the worst of the worst.\" This uses loaded language with phrases like \"worst of the worst\" to create a strong negative image. So that's Loaded Language.\n\nNext, it talks about Siraj Ibn Wahhaj training kids for school shootings. The text connects his actions to Linda through her mentor, implying she supports such activities without proof. That looks like Guilt by Association again.\n\nMentioning the compound as \"filthy\" adds emotional weight, which is another example of Loaded Language.\n\nThe part about Brett Kavanaugh's poll seems irrelevant to the main story. It distracts from the topic at hand, so that's a Red Herring.\n\nReferring to Wahhaj as an extremist and linking him to the 1993 WTC bombing connects him to terrorism without direct evidence. This is another Guilt by Association instance.\n\nThe mosque being described as attracting radical speakers ties it to extremism again, using fear to influence opinion, which is Appeal to Fear-Prejudice.\n\nOverall, I've identified several instances of Loaded Language and Guilt by Association, along with a Red Herring and an Appeal to Fear.

The author seems to argue that this block is a violation of the First Amendment and questions the judge's understanding of constitutional rights.\n\nLooking for propaganda techniques... Let me go through each paragraph.\n\nIn the first part, the author mentions that the judge should understand the First Amendment protection. That might be a straightforward statement, but when they bring in the Second Amendment, it could be an Appeal to Authority (0) since they're citing constitutional amendments as authorities without deeper discussion.\n\nThen there's a poll about Brett Kavanaugh. Repeating the same question three times seems like Repetition (13). It's trying to drill the question into the reader's mind.\n\nThe article quotes Judge Lasnik and mentions the temporary restraining order. Then it moves on to Trump's response, where he says making 3D guns available \"doesn't seem to make much sense.\" The author responds with rhetorical questions, which might be Loaded Language (8) because they're using emotional language to sway opinion.\n\nThe part where the author criticizes opponents for being serious about regulating guns but not about abortion is a clear example of Whataboutism (17). They're deflecting criticism by pointing to another issue, trying to discredit the opposition's position on guns by comparing it to their stance on abortion.\n\nWhen discussing the states suing, the author labels them as \"the usual suspects,\" which is Name-Calling or Labeling (9) because it's a pejorative term meant to dismiss their credibility without argument.\n\nThe article then quotes Washington's Attorney General and criticizes his interpretation of the Tenth Amendment. The author argues that Ferguson is reading communist ideology into the Constitution, which is another instance of Labeling (9), associating the opposing view with communism to discredit it.\n\nLater, the author mentions Defense Distributed's lawyer, Josh Blackman, explaining the legal process. This seems more informative but then transitions back to criticizing the judge and state attorneys general as unfit. That's an Appeal to Authority (0) again, using the Constitution as the ultimate authority without providing evidence beyond that.\n\nThe article ends with a call to action to win a Ghost Gunner 2, which is a Slogan (14), encouraging action in a catchy way.\n\nSo, I've identified several instances: Appeal to Authority multiple times, Repetition with the poll question, Loaded Language in the rhetorical questions, Whataboutism when comparing gun regulation to abortion, Name-Calling by labeling states as \"usual suspects,\" and using communist ideology as a label. There's also a Slogan at the end.\n\nI need to make sure each identified span is correctly categorized and that the reasons are clear.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me go through each paragraph step by step.\n\nFirst, the title: \"Texas: Cop Walks Into Home She Thought Was Hers, Kills Innocent Homeowner—Not Arrested.\" This seems to highlight a situation where a police officer isn't arrested after killing someone. The use of \"Innocent Homeowner\" and the fact that she wasn't arrested might be trying to evoke fear or anger towards the police.\n\nLooking at the first paragraph: It talks about the \"sheer insane state of law enforcement in America today.\" Using \"insane\" is strong language, which could be loaded language (technique 8) because it's emotionally charged and not neutral. Also, \"Highlighting\" might be trying to set a negative tone.\n\nNext, the article describes the officer entering the wrong home and killing Jean. It mentions she hasn't been arrested yet. The way this is presented seems to compare her treatment to that of an average citizen, implying favoritism. This could be Appeal_to_fear-prejudice (1) because it's instilling fear or mistrust towards the police.\n\nIn the statement from Dallas police, they explain the officer thought it was her own apartment. The article then contrasts this with what would happen to an average citizen, suggesting a double standard. This comparison is trying to build support by creating anxiety about unfair treatment, so that's another Appeal_to_fear-prejudice (1).\n\nThe part where the author says \"If an average citizen...\" and points out she was placed on leave instead of arrested is using exaggeration or minimization (6). It's emphasizing the difference in treatment to make the situation seem more unjust than it might be.\n\nRichard Healy Nelson's quote about being scared because police are supposed to protect adds emotional weight, playing into fear. This could also tie into Appeal_to_fear-prejudice (1).\n\nThe article mentions that this is the first time they've reported an off-duty cop doing this, which might be trying to create a sense of novelty or urgency, possibly using Exaggeration/Minimisation (6) by making it seem like a unique and thus more significant event.\n\nWhen talking about Jean's mother, the emotional impact is highlighted, which could be loaded language (8) as it tugs at the reader's emotions rather than just stating facts.\n\nThe conclusion that the officer hasn't been arrested is presented as a \"slap to the face\" of Jean’s parents. This phrase is emotionally charged and uses Loaded_Language (8) to convey strong disapproval without objective analysis.\n\nThroughout, the article repeatedly emphasizes police privilege and injustice, which could be seen as Name_Calling or Labeling (9), labeling the police with negative connotations.\n\nI also notice that the article uses a poll in the middle, asking who should replace Nikki Haley. This seems unrelated to the main story and might be a Red_Herring (11) to distract from the flow of the narrative about the shooting incident.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I can identify several spans where these techniques are used.", "annotator_group": 0}

The user has provided a list of 18 different techniques with their explanations and examples. My task is to go through each paragraph of the article and see if any sentences match these techniques.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire article to get an overview. It's about a couple in New Mexico who reported a missing boy and his father living on their property, but the police didn't search the compound until much later. The remains of a young boy were found, and there are concerns about why the police delayed their action.\n\nNow, I'll go through each paragraph one by one to check for propaganda techniques.\n\n1. **First Paragraph**: Talks about the couple telling authorities months ago but police delaying due to lack of probable cause. No obvious propaganda here; it's more factual reporting.\n\n2. **Second Paragraph**: The delay is facing scrutiny after remains were found. Still factual, no clear technique used.\n\n3. **Third Paragraph**: Tanya Badger criticizes the police for dragging their feet and taking too long. This seems like an appeal to emotion, specifically fear or concern for a child's life. So maybe Appeal_to_fear-prejudice (type 1).\n\n4. **Fourth Paragraph**: Describes the discovery of remains and starving children. Factual again.\n\n5. **Fifth Paragraph**: Upcoming court appearances; no technique here.\n\n6. **Sixth Paragraph**: Details about the raid and the father's alleged abduction. Still factual.\n\n7. **Seventh Paragraph**: Neighbors raised an alarm, Badgers saw the boy in January and February. They reported it but police took months to act. Again, Tanya expresses frustration. This could be Doubt (type 5) as she questions the credibility of the police's actions.\n\n8. **Eighth Paragraph**: Sheriff explains lack of probable cause and surveillance efforts. Factual.\n\n9. **Ninth Paragraph**: Authorities changed their view upon receiving a message about starving children. Factual, no technique.\n\n10. **Tenth Paragraph**: Description of the compound's condition. Factual.\n\n11. **Eleventh Paragraph**: Living conditions with weapons and ammo. Factual.\n\n12. **Twelfth Paragraph**: Arrests made but Badgers say police didn't search thoroughly. They found items missed by police. This could be Exaggeration/Minimisation (type 6) as they emphasize the thoroughness of their own search compared to the police's.\n\n13. **Thirteenth Paragraph**: Details about Abdul-Ghani's condition and his father's actions. Factual, but mentions \"horrifying scene\" which uses Loaded Language (type 8).\n\n14. **Fourteenth Paragraph**: Mother couldn't be reached; she talks about her husband taking the son. Factual.\n\n15. **Fifteenth Paragraph**: Arrest warrant mentions exorcism, but mother clarifies it's a ruqya. This could be Obfuscation/Intentional Vagueness (type 10) as the term \"exorcism\" is unclear and later clarified.\n\n16. **Sixteenth Paragraph**: Police stopped the father in Alabama; no warrant because of joint custody. Factual.\n\n17. **Seventeenth Paragraph**: SUV registered to Leveille, who was arrested later. Factual.\n\n18. **Eighteenth Paragraph**: Children taken into custody. Factual.\n\nSo, I identified several instances where propaganda techniques are used:\n\n- Tanya Badger's statement about dragging feet and a child's life at stake uses Appeal_to_fear-prejudice (type 1).\n- Her frustration expresses Doubt (type 5) towards the police's credibility.\n- The description of the compound as \"horrifying\" uses Loaded Language (type 8).\n- The mention of exorcism vs. ruqya is Obfuscation (type 10).\n\nI need to make sure each annotation includes reason, text, and type.

That's Name-Calling or Labeling (9).\n\nIn the first paragraph, it says Ellison is accused by two women who didn't wait to voice their accusations. It also mentions he follows a \"demonic religion\" and supports cop killers. The term \"demonic religion\" uses loaded language with strong negative connotations, so that's Loaded Language (8). Also, accusing him of supporting cop killers without evidence is another example of Labeling (9).\n\nNext, the article talks about Ellison seeking police protection from a journalist. It frames this as ironic given his support for those who murder police. This irony is used to build fear and prejudice against Ellison, so that's Appeal to Fear/Prejudice (1).\n\nThe text then describes Ellison fleeing from questions, which paints him in a negative light without balanced context. This could be Exaggeration or Minimization (6), making his actions seem more cowardly than they might be.\n\nFurther down, the article details Ellison's past with the Nation of Islam and support for figures like Sharif Willis. It presents this as troubling, using fear to sway opinion against him, another Appeal to Fear/Prejudice (1).\n\nThe repeated mention of Ellison supporting cop killers and associating him with dangerous groups is a form of Labeling (9) and Loaded Language (8), reinforcing negative stereotypes.\n\nIn discussing his support for Assata Shakur and others, the article uses fear-inducing language about terrorism and murder, which again is Appeal to Fear/Prejudice (1).\n\nFinally, the conclusion calls him \"Hakim Muhammad\" shamefully, which is another label meant to discredit him without evidence.

Each accusation is presented with details from the accusers and Franken's responses. The way these are laid out seems factual, but I should check for any loaded language or emotional appeals.\n\nLooking at the first accusation by Leeann Tweeden: she describes Franken groping and forcibly kissing her. The text mentions a photo showing Franken pretending to grab her breasts while she was asleep. Franken apologized for the photo but had a different recollection of the skit incident. This seems straightforward, just presenting both sides without obvious bias.\n\nNext, Lindsay Menz's accusation about Franken grabbing her buttocks in 2010. Franken didn't remember the picture but felt bad that she felt disrespected. Again, this is neutral reporting.\n\nThen there are two unidentified women from 2007 and 2008 with similar accusations. One mentions a suggestion to go to the bathroom together. Franken denies remembering these events. Still, no clear propaganda here.\n\nStephanie Kemplin's accusation from 2003 about Franken putting his hand on her breast during a USO tour. His office responded that he didn't intentionally engage in such conduct. Neutral again.\n\nA former elected official accuses Franken of trying to give her a wet kiss in 2006. No specific response from Franken noted here. Still factual.\n\nAn unnamed aide says Franken tried to forcibly kiss her and mentioned it's his right as an entertainer. Franken denies this. The text just reports the accusation and denial without emotional language.\n\nLastly, Tina Dupuy's accusation about Franken squeezing her waist during a photo in 2009. No response from him on that. Again, presented factually.\n\nI don't see any obvious propaganda techniques here.

It's about Clinton's public statements on apologizing for his affair with Lewinsky. He mentions that he apologized publicly but hasn't spoken to her privately. He also talks about dealing with the issue 20 years ago and moving on since then.\n\nNow, looking at each propaganda technique one by one:\n\n1. **Appeal_to_Authority**: Clinton is a former President, so if he cites his authority to justify his actions, that could be an example. But in this text, he's talking about his own feelings and actions, not citing others' expertise.\n\n2. **Appeal_to_fear-prejudice**: I don't see any fear-mongering or prejudice being appealed here. The discussion is more about personal accountability.\n\n3. **Bandwagon**: There's no mention of popular opinion or trying to get others to join a trend based on majority support.\n\n4. **Black-and-White_Fallacy**: Clinton presents his apology as sufficient, which might oversimplify the situation by not acknowledging the complexity of the issue. This could be a case where he's framing it as either apologized or not, without considering the depth needed.\n\n5. **Causal_Oversimplification**: He attributes dealing with the affair to just apologizing publicly and moving on, simplifying the long-term effects on Lewinsky, which she mentions in her essay regarding PTSD.\n\n6. **Doubt**: There's no questioning of credibility here; it's more about Clinton's own statements.\n\n7. **Exaggeration/Minimisation**: When he says he apologized to \"everybody in the world,\" that might be an exaggeration since he didn't apologize privately to Lewinsky. Also, minimizing the need for a private apology by emphasizing the public one could downplay its significance.\n\n8. **Flag-Waving**: No nationalistic or group appeal is present here.\n\n9. **Loaded_Language**: The text doesn't use emotionally charged words beyond what's necessary to report the facts.\n\n10. **Name_Calling/Labeling**: There are no derogatory labels used towards any individual or group.\n\n11. **Obfuscation/Intentional Vagueness**: Clinton's statement about apologizing publicly without addressing private apology could be seen as vague, avoiding the specifics of his actions towards Lewinsky.\n\n12. **Red_Herring**: The conversation stays focused on the apology and its sufficiency without diverting to unrelated topics.\n\n13. **Reductio_ad_hitlerum**: No comparison to disliked groups or figures is made here.\n\n14. **Repetition**: There's no notable repetition of phrases for persuasive effect.\n\n15. **Slogans**: No brief, catchy phrases are used in the text.\n\n16. **Straw_Men**: Clinton isn't misrepresenting anyone else's arguments here; he's stating his own position.\n\n17. **Thought-terminating_Cliches**: He uses phrases like \"I dealt with it 20 years ago,\" which might dismiss further discussion on the matter.\n\n18. **Whataboutism**: There's no attempt to deflect criticism by pointing out others' faults.\n\nSo, looking at these points, I can identify a few instances:\n\n- Clinton saying he apologized to \"everybody in the world\" is an **Exaggeration/Minimisation** because it's not true; he didn't apologize privately to Lewinsky. This minimizes the importance of a direct apology.\n\n- His statement that he dealt with it 20 years ago uses a **Thought-terminating Cliche**, implying that the matter is closed and shouldn't be discussed further.\n\n- By framing his public apology as sufficient, he's oversimplifying the situation, which could be a **Black-and-White Fallacy** because it ignores the complexity of whether a public apology alone is enough.\n\nI think these three points are the main propaganda techniques used here. Each instance should be annotated with the appropriate type and reasoning.", "annotator_group": 0}

So far, this seems factual without any obvious propaganda.\n\nMoving further, the text describes the officers as \"true American heroes\" and quotes the Police Chief saying they were \"two of the best we had.\" This language uses emotional appeal to patriotism and heroism, which could be a form of Flag-Waving (type 7). It's meant to evoke strong feelings of national pride and support.\n\nNext, Governor Kasich orders flags at half-staff, which is a symbolic gesture. The procession and social media posts from the police department are more about honoring the officers rather than propaganda.

My task is to go through the provided text and find sections where these techniques are applied.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire text carefully to understand the context. It's about CNN and Jim Acosta filing a lawsuit against the Trump administration regarding the revocation of Acosta's press pass after an incident during a news conference.\n\nNow, I'll go paragraph by paragraph, looking for any language or arguments that fit into the propaganda categories listed.\n\nStarting with the first few paragraphs: they're mostly factual, explaining the situation and the lawsuit. Nothing stands out as propaganda here.\n\nMoving on to where Sam Donaldson is mentioned. He claims CNN has sued and there's a court hearing. Then there's a poll asking if Acosta should have his pass back. The poll seems neutral, so maybe not propaganda yet.\n\nNext, it mentions that Donaldson was asked to prepare an affidavit because of his reputation for confronting the White House, including trading insults with President Bush in 2006. This might be using his authority as a reputable journalist to support their case, which could be an Appeal_to_Authority (0). But I'm not sure yet.\n\nThen, Donaldson encourages Acosta via email, telling him to keep up and not worry about attacks. This seems more like personal support rather than propaganda.\n\nCNN's statement says no decision has been made on the lawsuit, so that's factual. The White House hasn't responded either. Then Floyd Mayweather, a constitutional lawyer, is quoted saying CNN would have a strong case if they proceed. Again, using an expert opinion could be Appeal_to_Authority (0).\n\nThe next part describes the incident where Acosta's pass was suspended after a tussle with an intern over a microphone during his exchange with Trump. The text says Acosta disputes the accusation, claiming he never put his hands on her.\n\nThen comes this sentence: \"Watching the full exchange it is obvious that President Trump was making a sincere effort to answer Acosta’s questions, the president actually took the time to answer three of his questions before rightfully losing his patience when Acosta refused to hand the mic over.\" This seems to present only one side of the story as obvious, which might be Black-and-White Fallacy (3) by framing Trump's actions as entirely justified and Acosta's as wrong without considering other perspectives.\n\nContinuing on: \"Not only that, he used his hand to forcefully push the female interns arm away from the mic. Acosta should have been escorted from the room. He deserved to have his credentials revoked.\" This uses loaded language like \"forcefully push\" which has a strong negative connotation, so this could be Loaded_Language (8). Also, labeling Acosta's actions as deserving of punishment might be Name_Calling or Labeling (9), but it's more about the action than a label.\n\nPutting it all together, I identified two instances.

The user has provided a list of 18 different techniques with their explanations and examples. My task is to go through each paragraph of the article and see if any sentences match these techniques.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire article to get an overview. It's about Cody Wilson and his company Defense Distributed fighting to publish blueprints for 3D-printed guns. The White House and some states are involved in opposing this. There are mentions of legal battles, statements from various parties like the NRA and gun control groups.\n\nNow, I'll go through each paragraph one by one.\n\n1. **First Paragraph**: Talks about the legal fight and White House support. No obvious propaganda techniques here, just reporting facts.\n\n2. **Second Paragraph**: States that 8 US states and DC argued against the blueprints because they could fall into wrong hands. This seems like a legitimate concern, not necessarily propaganda.\n\n3. **Third Paragraph**: Describes the injunction by Judge Lasnik. Again, factual information without clear bias or technique.\n\n4. **Fourth Paragraph**: The Trump administration gave permission but now says they're reviewing it. Still more of a factual update.\n\n5. **Fifth Paragraph**: States that 8 states sued, arguing the blueprints could allow anyone to make untraceable guns. This is presenting the opposing side's argument factually.\n\n6. **Sixth Paragraph**: Wilson complying and seeking financial support. He mentions believing access to firearms is a fundamental right. This might be an Appeal to Emotion or Flag-Waving, but I'm not sure yet.\n\n7. **Seventh Paragraph (President 'glad' for review)**: Trump tweeted that making guns publicly available doesn't make sense. The White House clarifies the DOJ acted without approval and they're glad it's being reviewed. This seems like a statement of stance rather than propaganda.\n\n8. **Eighth Paragraph**: Sanders says the DOJ made a deal without Trump's approval, and he's glad for the delay. She also mentions existing laws already prohibit plastic firearms. The NRA echoes this. Now, here I notice something: both the administration and NRA are saying that the law already prohibits undetectable guns, implying Wilson's actions are moot. This could be an example of **Obfuscation, Intentional Vagueness, or Confusion (10)** because they're using existing laws to dismiss the current issue without addressing the new method of 3D printing.\n\n9. **Ninth Paragraph**: Explains how Wilson got around the law by adding a steel block. This is factual but shows a loophole. Not propaganda yet.\n\n10. **Tenth Paragraph ('The debate is over')**: Democratic senators introduce legislation, gun control groups applaud. Wilson claims the files are already public and can't be taken back. His statement seems to use **Exaggeration or Minimisation (6)** because he's making it seem like the situation is hopeless, which might not be entirely true.\n\n11. **Eleventh Paragraph**: Gun control groups relieved but express damage done. Brady Campaign calls 3D guns a menace. This is using **Loaded Language (8)** with words like \"menace\" to evoke fear.\n\n12. **Twelfth Paragraph**: Wilson's legal history and his website appeal for funds. His determination is shown, but no clear technique here.\n\n13. **Thirteenth Paragraph**: The message on the website asks for support \"to uncensor the site.\" This could be **Flag-Waving (7)** as it frames the issue in terms of freedom and rights, appealing to patriotic feelings.\n\nNow, I'll list each identified span with its reason, text, and annotation type.\n\n1. NRA's statement about existing laws: Obfuscation.\n2. Wilson claiming debate is over: Exaggeration.\n3. Brady Campaign calling guns a menace: Loaded Language.\n4. Website message on uncensoring: Flag-Waving.\n\nI think these are the main instances where propaganda techniques are used in the article.", "annotator_group": 0}

These are emotionally charged terms that could be using loaded language to provoke anxiety. So, I'll note this as Loaded_Language (annotation_type 8).\n\nNext, the article talks about patients escaping due to fear of needles and hospitals. This emphasizes a single cause—fear of medical treatment—for the spread of the plague, ignoring other factors like poor healthcare infrastructure or lack of education. That's Causal Oversimplification (type 4).\n\nThen, it mentions that each patient could infect 20 others, which is an exaggeration to highlight the risk. This seems like Exaggeration/Minimisation (type 6) because it magnifies the potential spread without context on containment measures.\n\nThe article also discusses the traditional burial practice being halted. The government's action is framed as necessary, but the way it's presented might be using fear of tradition leading to disease spread. This could be another example of Loaded_Language (type 8).\n\nLater, it warns about antibiotics resistance, stating it's \"inevitable\" and making the disease more terrifying. Using words like \"inevitable\" and \"terrifying\" again uses loaded language to instill fear, so that's another instance of type 8.\n\nFinally, the article suggests that if the plague spreads to Africa, it could become uncontrollable, leading to a pandemic.

Then it quotes the author's doubts about the door being ajar and questions if people usually leave doors unlocked at night. This is sowing doubt in Guyger's story, which fits Doubt (5).\n\nIt then contrasts Guyger's treatment with what others would face, implying favoritism. This uses Exaggeration or Minimisation (6) by highlighting disparity.\n\nMention of her previous shooting adds context but might be loaded to show a pattern, using Loaded Language (8).\n\nThe article ends with legal consequences and possible murder charges.

It might be trying to evoke fear or prejudice against Ellison by linking him to a controversial group without solid evidence.\n\nNext, the article states there's abundant evidence that Karen Monahan is telling the truth about Keith Ellison abusing her, while saying there's no evidence against Brett Kavanaugh. This seems like a Black-and-White Fallacy because it presents two cases as opposites without considering other possibilities or the complexity of each situation.\n\nThen, the text criticizes Democrats for focusing on Ford and Kavanaugh but ignoring Monahan, calling their #MeToo rhetoric hypocritical. This could be an example of Whataboutism, where they're diverting attention from their own actions by pointing out someone else's hypocrisy without addressing the issue directly.\n\nThe article also uses loaded language like \"pure politically-motivated hypocrisy,\" which has strong emotional implications and is meant to sway the reader's opinion negatively against Democrats.\n\nAdditionally, the mention of Ellison being linked to the Muslim Brotherhood could be an example of Reductio ad Hitlerum, where a negative association is made to discredit him without proper evidence.\n\nThere are also instances where the text minimizes Ellison's denial by focusing on Monahan's claims, which might be Exaggeration or Minimisation. The repeated emphasis on the doctor's report and the allegations could be Repetition to drive the point home.\n\nThe use of terms like \"abundant evidence\" versus \"absolutely no evidence\" is a clear example of Causal Oversimplification, as it oversimplifies the situations without considering all factors.\n\nLastly, the overall tone uses Name-Calling by labeling Ellison and the Democrats with negative terms to evoke fear or dislike.", "annotator_group": 0}

Also, \"dancing with corpses\" is a vivid image that could evoke strong emotions, so that's another example of loaded language.\n\nIn the first paragraph, it mentions that the plague is blamed on “dancing with corpses.” This tradition is described as a major cause of spreading the disease. The use of \"blamed on\" might be an example of causal oversimplification because it attributes the spread to a single cause without considering other factors like unsanitary conditions or lack of healthcare.\n\nThe second paragraph talks about health officials suspecting the outbreak coincides with the ritual. This seems more factual, so maybe no propaganda here.\n\nIn the third paragraph, Willy Randriamarotia explains how the bacteria can transmit during the ritual. Again, this is informative and not propagandistic.\n\nNext, some locals believe it's a government conspiracy. The text quotes Helene saying she'll continue the ritual and that \"The plague is a lie.\" This could be an example of denial or doubt, but more importantly, her statement might be a form of exaggeration or minimization by downplaying the plague's severity.\n\nThen, Josephine believes the government is exaggerating for money. This is doubting the credibility of health officials, so that's another instance of doubt.\n\nThe text also mentions warnings to tourists, which is factual. Finally, she says she's participated in 15 ceremonies without catching the plague, which might be an appeal to personal experience as evidence, but I'm not sure if it fits any specific category here.\n\nSo, summarizing the potential annotations:\n\n1. The title uses loaded language with \"AIRBORNE\" and \"dancing with corpses.\"\n2. Blaming the spread on the ritual is causal oversimplification.\n3. Helene's statement minimizes the plague's severity.\n4. Josephine's belief doubts the government's credibility.\n\nI think these are the main points where propaganda techniques are used.", "annotator_group": 0}

The judge ruled that due process wasn't followed but didn't address the First Amendment claim yet.\n\nLooking at the first part, it seems factual without emotional language. Moving on, Sarah Huckabee Sanders' statement says there's no absolute right to access the White House and mentions they'll temporarily reinstate the pass while developing rules for decorum.

This could be Exaggeration or Minimization (6) if it's overstating the situation, but I'm not sure yet.\n\nMark Lukasiewicz praises the judge's decision and says the White House has other ways to handle reporters. He mentions it's not the first time a reporter behaved in a way a president didn't like. This seems more factual without clear propaganda.\n\nThe article notes that CNN received support from Fox News and others, even though Fox was critical of Obama.

The user has provided a list of 18 different techniques with their explanations and examples. My task is to go through each paragraph of the article and see if any sentences match these techniques.\n\nFirst, I'll read through the entire article to get an overview. It's about the White House restoring Jim Acosta's press pass but imposing new conduct rules for all correspondents. The article mentions that CNN dropped their lawsuit after the pass was restored, but also notes that other media outlets are concerned about the implications of these new rules.\n\nNow, I'll go through each paragraph one by one and check for any propaganda techniques.\n\n1. **First Paragraph:**\n- \"Thanks to Jim Acosta, all White House correspondents have to adhere to the new rules.\"\n- This seems to blame Acosta for the new rules, implying that his actions are the sole cause. That might be an example of Causal Oversimplification (technique 4), where a single person is held responsible without considering other factors.\n\n2. **Second Paragraph:**\n- \"CNN’s White House correspondent Jim Acosta will get his 'hard pass' restored, but thanks to his antics and confrontations with President Trump and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, all journalists seeking access will have to abide by written rules of conduct due to his misbehavior.\"\n- Again, this attributes the new rules solely to Acosta's behavior. This is another instance of Causal Oversimplification (4).\n\n3. **Third Paragraph:**\n- \"Sanders and Shine sent a letter... notifying him that his hard pass was restored but could be suspended again if he fails to abide by the new rules.\"\n- No clear propaganda technique here, just stating facts.\n\n4. **Fourth Paragraph:**\n- Explains the rules about asking questions. No techniques spotted.\n\n5. **Fifth Paragraph:**\n- \"BREAKING NEWS...\" and a tweet. The tweet itself is more of an announcement, not employing a technique.\n\n6. **Poll Section:**\n- Asks if Acosta should have gotten his pass back with options like \"Yes\" or \"No, you can't act like a child.\" The option \"act like a child\" uses loaded language (technique 8) to evoke negative emotions towards Acosta's behavior.\n\n7. **Continuation:**\n- \"Should you refuse to follow these rules in the future...\" This is just a statement of consequences, no technique here.\n\n8. **Next Paragraphs:**\n- Describes the incident where Acosta argued with Trump and prevented an intern from taking the mic. Then mentions CNN suing and the judge's decision. These are factual, so no techniques.\n\n9. **Later Paragraph:**\n- \"Mainstream media outlets... celebrated Monday’s letter, framing it as the White House 'backing down' while ignoring implications of new rules.\"\n- The phrase \"backing down\" could be loaded language (8) to frame the White House's action in a particular light.\n\n10. **Quote from Sanders and Shine:**\n- They express regret but say they had to create explicit rules because of CNN's stance. This is factual, no technique.\n\n11. **Final Paragraphs:**\n- Discusses implications for reporters and First Amendment grounds. No techniques here.\n\nSo, the identified spans are:\n\n- \"Thanks to Jim Acosta...\" (Causal Oversimplification)\n- \"...thanks to his antics...\" (Causal Oversimplification)\n- Poll option: \"No, you can't act like a child...\" (Loaded Language)\n- \"...framing it as the White House 'backing down'...\" (Loaded Language)\n\nEach of these will be annotated with their respective reasons and types.", "annotator_group": 0}

This could be Exaggeration or Minimisation (type 6), making the problem seem larger than it is.\n\nThe article ends with a call to support anti-establishment candidates, using phrases like \"drain the swamp\" and describing the government as a \"cesspool.\" These are Slogans (type 14) meant to rally support emotionally rather than through reasoned argument.\n\nThroughout, the text uses strong emotional language and presents information in a way that builds a case against the political establishment without balanced discussion.

That seems like fear appeal because it's creating anxiety about a worst-case scenario without much evidence yet.\n\nIn the second paragraph, officials warn that resistance is inevitable and makes the disease more terrifying. Again, using words like \"terrifying\" and inevitability to instill fear.\n\nThe third paragraph mentions antibiotics as the only treatment but then says overuse leads to resistance. This could be seen as a causal oversimplification because it attributes resistance solely to antibiotic use without considering other factors.\n\nNext, it talks about the healthcare system being overwhelmed. The language here is pretty strong and might be using loaded language to evoke fear.\n\nA scientist from the Daily Mail is cited, which adds authority but doesn't provide evidence beyond their expertise. This could be an appeal to authority since we're relying on their warning without more data.\n\nThe text mentions scores of doctors and nurses getting sick, predicting the disease will gather momentum. This seems like exaggeration or minimization because it's emphasizing the worst-case scenario without balancing it with current containment efforts.\n\nOfficial figures show 2,034 infected and 165 deaths, called the \"worst outbreak in 50 years.\" Labeling it as such might be loaded language to emphasize severity beyond the facts.\n\nExperts express concerns about antibiotic resistance, which is a valid point but presented in a way that increases fear. Professor McFadden says if resistance kicks in, the plague becomes scarier. This is another appeal to fear.\n\nDr. Gatherer explains Madagascar's limited healthcare resources. While factual, it's presented to highlight the impending doom, which might be using fear again.\n\nThe text continues to fear the system being overwhelmed and mentions the possibility of a global pandemic if it spreads. This is more fear-prejudice because it's building anxiety about potential spread without discussing current measures.\n\nThroughout, the repeated emphasis on inevitability and terrifying outcomes seems to use fear to persuade readers about the severity. There's also loaded language with words like \"terrifying,\" \"overwhelmed,\" and \"medieval disease.\"\n\nI don't see other techniques like bandwagon or straw men here.

It mentions the father being arrested at a compound where children were trained for school shootings. The imam says he didn't know about the training, but his mosque has attracted radicals before.\n\nI notice that the text uses terms like \"Muslims\" and describes the compound's conditions as terrible. It also quotes the mosque spokesman saying it's just a domestic situation, which the author disputes by pointing out the training details from court documents.\n\nLooking for propaganda techniques:\n\n1. **Loaded Language**: Words like \"Muslims,\" \"trained to engage in mass school shootings,\" \"third world conditions\" have strong negative connotations. This could be loaded language meant to evoke fear or prejudice.\n\n2. **Appeal to Fear/Prejudice**: The text repeatedly links Islam with terrorism and oppression, which plays on existing fears and prejudices against Muslims.

The phrase \"perpetual state of confusion\" about friends and enemies is a doubt technique (5), questioning Obama's credibility without direct evidence.\n\nThe article then describes Iranian protests and how Trump supported them, while criticizing Obama for being silent. This uses exaggeration/minimisation (6) by highlighting Trump's actions positively and minimizing Obama's efforts.\n\nWhen discussing Obama's administration, terms like \"obsequious acolytes\" and \"despotic mullahs\" are name-calling (9), labeling opponents negatively. The text also mentions missing opportunities for regime change, which is a causal oversimplification (4) as it attributes complex events to a single factor.\n\nThe article talks about Obama selling everything for the JCPOA, using phrases like \"ransom payments\" and \"henchmen,\" which are loaded language (8). It also claims that Iran's breaches were ignored, another exaggeration/minimisation (6).\n\nDiscussing Trump's actions, it uses positive terms like \"robust foreign policy\" and \"new sheriff in town,\" which is flag-waving (7) by appealing to national strength.

It's about Stacey Abrams suing Georgia over election mismanagement. She accuses Brian Kemp of voter suppression, and there's a lot of legal talk and quotes from both sides.\n\nLooking at the first part: \"Stacey Abrams quits race for governor of Georgia, accusing rival Republican Brian Kemp of voter suppression.\" This seems like Name-Calling or Labeling because she's accusing Kemp directly, which could be labeling him negatively. So that might fall under technique 9.\n\nNext, in Abrams' speech, she says Kemp relied on \"suppression of the people’s democratic right to vote\" and calls it deliberate and intentional. That sounds like Loaded Language (technique 8) because words like \"suppression\" have strong negative connotations.\n\nThen, Kemp responds by saying the election is over and Georgians are ready to move forward, focusing on a bright future. This could be an Appeal to Fear-Prejudice (technique 1), implying that Abrams' actions might hinder progress or cause division.\n\nKemp also calls Abrams' refusal to concede a \"publicity stunt\" and a \"ridiculous temper tantrum.\" That's definitely Name-Calling (technique 9) because he's using derogatory terms to describe her actions.\n\nLawrence-Hardy mentions that Abrams believes many supporters faced electoral barriers, especially minorities and low-income voters. This could be playing into the audience's emotions regarding social justice, which might be Flag-Waving (technique 7), appealing to group identity or values.\n\nI need to make sure each identified span is correctly matched with the right technique. For example, when Abrams uses strong terms against Kemp, it's Loaded Language. When Kemp dismisses her actions with negative labels, that's Name-Calling. His emphasis on moving forward and focusing on the future might be Fear-Prejudice if it's implying negative consequences otherwise.\n\nI should also check for other techniques like Exaggeration or Minimisation, but I don't see obvious examples here.

This could be a form of authority appeal (technique 0), as he's an expert, so his warnings carry weight without much evidence.\n\nHe talks about poor sanitation and vector control issues, making it seem like the situation is dire.

The text says almost everyone had such stories, which might be exaggerating the prevalence. That could be Exaggeration/Minimisation (6). Also, quoting a political veteran calling it a \"sex trade\" is more loaded language.\n\nThe article then talks about the need to clean up the government and mentions the rest of the world laughing, which plays on national pride.

Todd's shock is also emphasized to highlight the issue emotionally.\n\nWhen discussing why Congress members aren't exposed, the text uses rhetorical questions, which can create doubt about the system's credibility.

Let me go through each paragraph step by step.\n\nFirst, the article talks about domestic abuse allegations against Keith Ellison. The lawyer couldn't substantiate them because the ex-girlfriend wouldn't provide video evidence. That seems straightforward, but maybe there's something here. I don't see any obvious propaganda yet.\n\nNext, it mentions that the report was released without their knowledge by someone outside. Hmm, could this be an example of Obfuscation or Intentional Vagueness? Maybe not directly. It just states a fact about the leak.\n\nKen Martin says they're turning over the report to law enforcement for objectivity. That sounds responsible, but I don't see a propaganda technique here.\n\nEllison denies the allegations and thanks the lawyer for a thorough review. He also mentions focusing on election issues. Maybe he's using Flag-Waving by emphasizing his dedication to the election, which could appeal to patriotic feelings towards the political process.\n\nThen, Monahan alleged Ellison dragged her off a bed in 2016. She had video but didn't release it due to embarrassment or trauma. The article notes her shifting reasons for not producing the footage. This might relate to Doubt, as her credibility is being questioned because of inconsistent explanations.\n\nThe Democratic party's investigation used an attorney linked to them. That could be a point of contention regarding bias, but I'm not sure if that's propaganda unless it's framed in a way to discredit the investigation.\n\nMonahan compares her treatment by the Democrats to their support for Ford. She feels smeared and isolated. This seems like she's pointing out hypocrisy, which might tie into Whataboutism, where they counter criticism by pointing to another issue (like Kavanaugh) instead of addressing hers directly.\n\nShe provides medical records and mentions others corroborating her story. That's evidence, not propaganda.\n\nMonahan says she knew she wouldn't be believed, which is a statement about her expectation but doesn't use a technique here.\n\nDemocrats supported Ford more than Monahan, which again points to possible hypocrisy, reinforcing the Whataboutism angle.\n\nMonahan insists her story isn't political and criticizes both parties for caring only when it's politically beneficial. This could be an Appeal to Fear-Prejudice if she's trying to instill anxiety about political motivations, but I'm not sure.\n\nShe mentions healing and not thinking about politics, which is more of a personal statement without clear propaganda.\n\nPutting this together, the main points where propaganda might be used are:\n\n1. Ellison focusing on election issues could be Flag-Waving.\n2. Monahan's shifting reasons for not providing evidence might cast Doubt on her credibility.\n3. The comparison between her treatment and Ford's could be Whataboutism to deflect attention.\n\nI think these three instances fit the criteria, so I'll annotate them accordingly.", "annotator_group": 0}

They're accusing the media of lying through their \"Communist teeth,\" which is loaded language using \"Communist\" as a negative term. That's Loaded Language and also Name-Calling because it's labeling them as Communists.\n\nThen they mention Infowars enhancing the video, not doctoring it.

This seems like they're trying to shift blame from themselves to others, which might be a Red Herring or Whataboutism if they're diverting attention from their own actions.\n\nWhen they call out specific people like Steven Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel, saying they're lying, that's Name-Calling again.

Let me go through each paragraph step by step.\n\nFirst, the article starts by saying that Bill Clinton insists he doesn't owe Monica an apology. He mentions he's apologized publicly but not directly to her. That might be a form of minimization because he's downplaying his personal responsibility by saying a public apology is enough.\n\nNext, it describes him as more famous for his affairs than policies, which could be loaded language using \"Don Juan-like seductions\" to create a negative image. Then, Clinton portrays himself as the victim, shifting blame away from himself and onto the media. That seems like a Straw Man fallacy because he's misrepresenting the situation.\n\nThe article mentions Lewinsky becoming an anti-bullying activist and calling it a 'gross abuse of power.'

This could be Obfuscation or Intentional Vagueness because he's diverting attention from his own actions.\n\nHe talks about leaving the presidency in debt and now being worth $80 million.

That seems more like factual reporting without any clear propaganda technique yet.\n\nMoving on, the administration set new rules for reporters' behavior. They restricted questions and allowed follow-ups at their discretion. The article notes that this is unusual. I don't see a direct propaganda technique here; it's more of an action being reported.\n\nNext, the White House blamed Acosta for disrespect, while Trump often insults journalists. This could be an example of \"Doubt\" (5) because it questions Acosta's credibility by labeling his behavior as disrespectful without providing evidence beyond the administration's claim.\n\nThen, the ACLU is quoted saying the rules give too much discretion and that the White House isn't for the president but the public. The statement uses strong language about scrutiny and politeness, which might be \"Loaded Language\" (8) because it's emotionally charged to influence opinion against the rules.\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders' statement mentions preferring professional norms and believing most journalists agree. This could be \"Appeal to Authority\" (0), as she's citing a majority of journalists supporting their stance, though it's more about consensus than authority.\n\nThe article then contrasts Trump with Obama, noting that Obama preselected outlets and chastised reporters. This comparison might be \"Whataboutism\" (17) because it brings up past actions to deflect criticism of the current administration's behavior.\n\nFurther down, Bill Shine sent a letter listing reasons for revoking Acosta's pass, which CNN called an after-the-fact process. The use of \"after-the-fact concocted process\" is pejorative, so that's another instance of \"Loaded Language\" (8).\n\nAides say Trump doesn't mind questions but complain about disrespectful reporters. This seems to shift blame and could be \"Doubt\" again, questioning the press's behavior.\n\nSanders suggests the onus is on the press to avoid needing a code of conduct, which sounds like a warning. The Correspondents' Association responds by expecting follow-ups to continue. Their statement might use \"Loaded Language\" (8) by emphasizing tradition and expectation against the new rules.\n\nPutting it all together, I identified several instances where loaded language was used to influence emotions, doubt cast on individuals' credibility, and whataboutism to deflect criticism.", "annotator_group": 0}

Releasing such info then could be seen as trying to instill fear or prejudice against Jean, making people think less of him. That seems like Appeal_to_fear-prejudice (1).\n\nWhen the article says the police found 10.4 grams and a grinder, it's minimizing the amount to show how insignificant it is. But by focusing on this, they're trying to shift blame from the officer to Jean. This is Causal_Oversimplification (4) because it oversimplifies the situation.\n\nAttorney Lee Merritt says police immediately began smearing him. Using \"smear\" again is loaded language, so another instance of Loaded_Language (8).\n\nMerritt mentions criminalizing the victim with no bearing on the shooting. This is Exaggeration/Minimisation (6) because it's emphasizing the negative to shift blame.\n\nThe article points out that nothing was released about Guyger's warrants. This could be Obfuscation (10) as they're being vague about her actions, making the audience focus on Jean instead.\n\nMerritt accuses the department of a \"common assassination attempt.\" That's loaded language again, so another Loaded_Language (8).\n\nThe article states it's standard for police to dig up dirt. This is a Thought-terminating Cliche (16) because it's a common phrase that stops critical thinking about why they do this.\n\nWhen the article says smear campaigns \"work most of the time,\" it's using Exaggeration/Minimisation (6) to emphasize their effectiveness without evidence.\n\nGuyger mistook Jean's apartment, and the warrant says she gave commands. This is a Straw Man (15) because it misrepresents Jean's actions by implying he was at fault for not obeying an intruder.\n\nThe part about Guyger having to verify the address outside is another point of contradiction. It's trying to discredit her story, which could be Doubt (5).\n\nWitnesses heard her banging on the door, contradicting her claim it was ajar. This is Reductio_ad_hitlerum (12) because it's associating her with negative actions.\n\nThe doors have an automatic close mechanism, so the ajar claim is false. Again, this is Doubt (5) as it questions Guyger's credibility.\n\nJean had a red mat, making it unlikely she'd mistake the apartment. This is Exaggeration/Minimisation (6) to show how obvious it was.\n\nThe tweet pointing out the homicidal cop inside is loaded language again (8), emphasizing the officer's guilt.\n\nThroughout, the article uses \"smear\" and focuses on minimal marijuana to shift blame, which are multiple instances of Loaded_Language (8).\n\nSo I've identified several spans with different propaganda techniques.

Let me go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, the title mentions \"FBI Arrests 5 Muslims From New Mexico Jihad Compound...\" The use of \"Jihad\" here might be loaded language because it's a term often associated with terrorism and could evoke fear or prejudice against Muslims. That seems like Appeal_to_fear-prejudice (type 1).\n\nLooking at the first paragraph, it talks about charges being dropped and the FBI arresting five Islamists. The text uses terms like \"Muslim jihadis\" and \"Islamists,\" which are emotionally charged labels. This could be Name_Calling or Labeling (type 9) because it's assigning a negative label to the group.\n\nIn the second paragraph, there's a mention of a district attorney failing to file charges on time and not showing up to court. The text then says this happened because the DA didn't do their job. This seems like Doubt (type 5), questioning the credibility of the DA without providing full context.\n\nThe article includes a poll asking who should replace Nikki Haley, which isn't directly related to the main story. This might be a Red_Herring (type 11) as it diverts attention from the compound case to an unrelated political issue.\n\nWhen discussing the charges against Jany Leveille and others, the text emphasizes their nationalities and illegal status, using terms like \"Haitian national illegally present.\" This could be Loaded_Language (type 8) because it's highlighting their immigration status in a way that might provoke fear or bias.\n\nThe article criticizes the FBI for ignoring intelligence, implying they could have prevented the child's death. This is Exaggeration/Minimisation (type 6) as it simplifies complex events and places excessive blame on the FBI without full evidence.\n\nLater, the text questions the DA's trustworthiness by comparing it to the FBI's, using phrases like \"Yeah, well, that's about as trustworthy...\" This is another instance of Doubt (type 5), undermining credibility without justification.\n\nThe article suggests President Trump should get involved and criticizes him for not acting sooner. It also mentions firing Sessions and bringing in someone serious. This could be Appeal_to_Authority (type 0) if it's implying that only a strong authority figure can fix the situation, though I'm not entirely sure here.\n\nFinally, the text ends by suggesting an FBI coverup and their own complicity, which is a conspiracy theory without evidence. This might be Obfuscation or Intentional Vagueness (type 10) as it's making unclear accusations that could confuse readers.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me go through it step by step.\n\nFirst, the article is about a judge ordering the White House to restore Jim Acosta's press pass, and Trump's response. The author seems critical of the ruling and Acosta.\n\nLooking at the beginning, the author mentions that the judge was appointed by Trump but still ruled against the White House. That might be setting up an authority figure, so maybe Appeal_to_Authority (0). But I'm not sure yet.\n\nThen, the article quotes the judge saying due process was violated. The author argues that Acosta wasn't charged with a crime and thus due process doesn't apply. This seems like they're minimizing the situation, perhaps Exaggeration/Minimisation (6).\n\nNext, there's a poll asking if Acosta should get his pass back. Repeating the same question three times might be Repetition (13) to drill the point into readers.\n\nThe author states that the Fifth Amendment doesn't apply here and calls it an issue of privilege, not rights. This could be Loaded Language (8) because they're using strong terms to influence opinion against Acosta.\n\nThey mention Infowars wanting a press pass too, implying that if Acosta gets one, others like Infowars should as well. That might be a Straw Man (15), misrepresenting the argument about press passes.\n\nThe author criticizes CNN as \"lying\" and \"propagandizing,\" which is Name-Calling or Labeling (9). They're using pejorative terms to discredit CNN.\n\nTrump's response includes saying they'll create rules for conduct. The author supports this, suggesting ignoring Acosta in future conferences. This could be Flag-Waving (7) by appealing to nationalistic feelings about press freedom and respect for the White House.\n\nThroughout, the text uses emotional language like \"badgering,\" \"shouting out questions,\" and \"making statements.\" That's Loaded Language (8) again, trying to sway opinion against Acosta.\n\nThe author also brings up Acosta touching a White House aide, which was widely debunked. This might be Doubt (5), questioning Acosta's credibility without solid evidence.\n\nFinally, the repeated criticism of CNN and the judge's decision could be Reductio_ad_hitlerum (12) if they're implying that supporting Acosta is akin to supporting something negative, but I'm not sure it fits perfectly here.\n\nSo, compiling all these points, I can identify several propaganda techniques in use.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me go through each paragraph step by step.\n\nFirst, the article talks about CNN suing Trump over Acosta's press pass. It mentions the lawsuit alleges violations of the First and Fifth Amendments. That seems factual, so no propaganda here.\n\nNext, it describes the incident where Acosta refused to give up the microphone and pushed an intern's hand. The text says he disputed this, claiming he didn't touch her. But then it states that watching the exchange shows Trump was sincere and Acosta was argumentative, pushing her arm away. This seems like a biased portrayal, framing Acosta negatively without neutral language.\n\nThen there's a poll asking if Acosta should get his pass back with options like \"Yes\" or \"No, you can't act like a child.\" The phrasing \"act like a child\" uses loaded language to influence opinion against him. That's Loaded_Language (8).\n\nThe article continues by stating the video shows facts that Acosta was out of line. This is an Appeal_to_Authority (0) because it presents the video as an authority without considering other interpretations.\n\nCNN's statement says the revocation violates their rights and could chill other journalists. This is a legitimate argument, not propaganda.\n\nThe White House's response includes Sanders saying Acosta placed his hands on the intern, calling it unacceptable. Some outlets called the video doctored, but Sanders didn't back down. She tweeted about inappropriate behavior clearly documented, which might be using the video as evidence. If the video was altered, this could be Obfuscation (10) by using unclear or misleading info.\n\nConway said the video was just sped up, which is a defense against doctoring claims. The attorney's statement that the law is clear about violations is factual.\n\nSo, I identified three instances: Loaded_Language in the poll question, Appeal_to_Authority regarding the video as fact, and Obfuscation from Sanders using possibly doctored evidence.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me read through it carefully.\n\nThe article starts by talking about Trump firing Tillerson and replacing him with Pompeo. It mentions that this is another big shake-up in the administration. Then it goes on to discuss Pompeo's beliefs about Russia and his stance on various policies. The author seems critical, comparing Pompeo to Clinton and Obama, suggesting that their foreign policies were problematic.\n\nLooking for propaganda techniques... Let me go through each paragraph.\n\nFirst part: Announcing Tillerson's replacement. Doesn't seem to have any obvious propaganda yet. It's more factual.\n\nNext, the article says it's a big shake-up and questions about foreign policy and Trump's relationship with the deep state. Maybe that's loaded language because \"deep state\" is a term with strong connotations.\n\nThen, comparing Pompeo to Clinton: \"If you enjoyed Hillary Clinton’s tenure... you’ll like Pompeo’s.\" This could be using a negative association, implying that if you didn't like Clinton, you won't like Pompeo either. That might be Appeal to Fear or Prejudice (type 1) because it's playing on existing feelings towards Clinton.\n\nThe article then describes Pompeo's views on Russia and mentions his statements about WikiLeaks. It quotes him calling WikiLeaks a \"non-state hostile intelligence service\" and ties it to Russia. This could be Loaded Language (type 8) because terms like \"hostile intelligence service\" are emotionally charged.\n\nWhen talking about Haspel, the new CIA director, the article brings up her involvement in torture. It uses strong language like \"big fan of torture,\" which is definitely loaded language (type 8). Also, it goes into detail about her role in black sites and waterboarding, which could be Exaggeration or Minimization (type 6) if it's overstating her role for effect.\n\nThe conclusion ties the appointments to Bush and Obama policies, suggesting continuity. The phrase \"Clinton City\" might be Name-Calling or Labeling (type 9), using a term that carries negative connotations for some readers.\n\nI also notice repetition of negative terms about Russia and torture, which could be Repetition (type 13) to reinforce a negative image.\n\nSo, the main techniques I spot are Loaded Language, Appeal to Fear/Prejudice, Exaggeration/Minimization, Name-Calling, and maybe Repetition.

This seems more like a warning based on the situation rather than fear-mongering, but I should keep an eye out for any emotional language.\n\nThe article provides specific numbers and dates, which are verifiable facts. It details the types of plague cases, which is informative without any clear bias. The explanation of how the plague spreads and its symptoms is educational, not persuasive.\n\nWhen discussing the incubation period and difficulty in curing in underdeveloped regions, it's highlighting the severity but doesn't seem to use fear as a tool beyond informing. The mention of CNN, WHO, and BNGRC adds credibility without appealing to authority improperly.\n\nThe part where experts warn that this outbreak is different because it started earlier and in new areas is still within the realm of factual reporting. It's providing expert opinion without just relying on authority for the sake of persuasion.\n\nThe historical context about the bubonic plague causing pandemics is educational. The emphasis on early detection and antibiotics is important information, not propaganda.\n\nTowards the end, the article notes the international response with specific numbers on antibiotics and funds. This shows a serious response but doesn't use emotional appeals or loaded language beyond stating facts.\n\nThroughout the text, I don't notice any clear instances of propaganda techniques like appeal to authority without evidence, fear-prejudice, bandwagon, etc. The language is straightforward and informative, aiming to educate rather than persuade through manipulative methods.", "annotator_group": 0}
