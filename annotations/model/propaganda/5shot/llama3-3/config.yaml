  description: 'Stating that a claim is true simply because a valid authority or expert
    on the issue said it was true, without any other supporting evidence offered.
    We consider the special case in which the reference is not an authority or an
    expert in this technique, altough it is referred to as Testimonial in literature.    Example
    1: "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert
    in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it''s true."    Explanation:
    Richard Dawkins certainly knows about evolution, and he can confidently tell us
    that it is true, but that doesn''t make it true. What makes it true is the preponderance
    of evidence for the theory.    Example 2: "According to Serena Williams, our foreign
    policy is the best on Earth. So we are in the right direction." Details: since
    there is a chance that any authority can be wrong, it is reasonable to defer to
    an authority to support a claim, but the authority should not be the only justification
    to accept the claim, otherwise the Appeal-to-Authority fallacy is committed.'

  \ for global anti-migrant alliance with eye on 2018 elections\n(Fixes dateline)\n\
  * PM Orban faces elections on April 8, leads all polls\n* Migration has been Orban's\
  \ defining theme since 2015\n* Says will counter globalism alongside U.S., UK, Israel\n\
  By Marton Dunai\nBUDAPEST, Feb 18 (Reuters) - Hungarian leader Viktor Orban called\
  \ on Sunday for a global alliance against migration as his right-wing populist Fidesz\
  \ party began campaigning for an April 8 election in which it is expected to win\
  \ a third consecutive landslide victory.\nPopular at home but increasingly at odds\
  \ politically and economically with mainstream European Union peers, Orban has thrived\
  \ on external controversy, including repeated clashes with Brussels and lately the\
  \ United Nations.\nThose conflicts, mostly centred on migration since people fleeing\
  \ war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa flooded into Europe in 2015, have\
  \ intensified as the elections approach and Orban poses as a saviour of Europe's\
  \ Christian nations.\n\"Christianity is Europe's last hope,\" Orban told an audience\
  \ of party faithful at the foot of the Royal Castle in Budapest.\nWith mass immigration,\
  \ especially from Africa, \"our worst nightmares can come true.\nThe West falls\
  \ as it fails to see Europe being overrun.\"\nOrban is widely credited for reversing\
  \ an economic slump in Hungary and controlling its public finances, culminating\
  \ in a return to investment-grade for its debt, which was cut to 'junk' during the\
  \ 2008 global economic crisis.\nTo achieve that and hold onto power the prime minister,\
  \ 54, has used methods that critics have called authoritarian, and picked fights\
  \ with EU partners, especially in the West.\nEastern leaders, most notably in Poland,\
  \ have followed his lead.\nBut migration dominates his agenda now.\nOrban said on\
  \ Sunday that Europe faces a critical fissure between nation states of the East\
  \ and the West, which he called an \"immigrant zone, a mixed population world that\
  \ heads in a direction different from ours\".\nAs the West wants eastern Europe\
  \ to follow its lead, an increasingly vicious strugglewas likely, he said, alluding\
  \ to a plan to redraw the European alliance advocated by the leaders of France and\
  \ Germany.\n\"Absurd as it may sound the danger we face comes from the West, from\
  \ politicians in Brussels, Berlin and Paris,\"Orban said to loud applause.\n\"Of\
  \ course we will fight, and use ever stronger legal tools.\nThe first is our 'Stop\
  \ Soros'law.\"\nOrban has for years targeted Hungarian-born U.S. financier George\
  \ Soros, whose philanthropy aims to bolster liberal and open-border values -- anathema\
  \ to Orban, an advocate of a loose group of strong nation states that reject multiculturalism.\n\
  The Hungarian leader has advocated \"ethnic homogeneity\" and compared Soros, a\
  \ Jew, to a puppet masterunleashing immigration onto Europeto undermine its cultural\
  \ and economic integrity.\nA defining moment of his premiership came in 2015, as\
  \ the migrant crisis peaked: he built a double razor wire fence that became the\
  \ symbol of anti-migrant sentiment in Europe.\nOrban also said the Hungarian opposition\
  \ had failed to heed the call of history when it opposed his toughness on migrants.\n\
  Voters have responded favourably and Orban is a clear leader of all polls.\nPOWERFUL\
  \ ALLIES\nOrban has conflated the issue of immigration with the image of Soros,\
  \ 87, whose name was used in a tough anti-migrant bill sent to Parliament on Wednesday.\n\
  Soros, for his part, compared Orban unfavourably to both the Nazis and the Communists,saying\
  \ his rule evoked dark tones from the 1930's -- when Hungary was allied with Nazi\
  \ Germany -- and was more oppressive than Cold War Soviet occupation.\nOrban has\
  \ tightened the screws on non-government organisations, particularly ones funded\
  \ by Soros, and attempted to close a prominent Soros-founded university.\nAttributing\
  \ to Soros a recent United Nations plan on creating a global blueprint to handle\
  \ the migration crisis, Orban said he anticipated that powerful allies would help\
  \ him prevent the U.N. from greasing the wheels of migration.\n\"Soros has antagonised\
  \ not only us but also England, President Trump and Israel too,\" he said.\n\"Everywhere\
  \ he wants to get migration accepted.\nIt won't work.\nWe are not alone and we will\
  \ fight together ... and we will succeed.\"\nIn Europe, he cited as allies Hungary's\
  \ fellow Visegrad countries Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland, whose ruling\
  \ Law and Justice (PiS) party is also often at loggerheads with the EU.\nHe said\
  \ a victory for Silvio Berlusconi's party in Italy's March 4 election would strengthen\
  \ the nationalist fold.\n\"We don't think the fight is hopeless, on the contrary,\
  \ we are winning,\" Orban said.\n\"The V4 is firm, Croatia has come around, Austria\
  \ has turned in the patriotic direction, and in Bavaria the CSU has created a resistance.\"\

  \ occurred around Las Vegas, up and down the Strip that night.\nIt wasn\u2019t just\
  \ centralized around the Mandalay Hotel,\u201D the witness claimed.\nThe eyewitness\
  \ then goes on to directly say that he and his wife were involved in an active shooter\
  \ situation at a different hotel that authorities have so far done everything in\
  \ their power to cover-up.\n\u201CMy wife and I were in Las Vegas celebrating our\
  \ 10th anniversary and on October 1st we were involved in an incident with an active\
  \ shooter at the Bellagio.\nThere is no mistake in my mind about it,\u201D he continued.\n\
  Jeff then describes a scene in which he and his wife were walking through the main\
  \ lobby when screams and gunfire erupted.\nKeep in mind, this is all information\
  \ that the police and the FBI has hidden from the American people.\n\u201CAll of\
  \ a sudden there was just a crescendo of screams that started behind us in the lobby,\u201D\
  \ he claimed.\n\u201CThen I heard somebody yell \u2018there\u2019s a shooter!\n\
  There\u2019s a shooter!\u2019 And then I heard like five or six pops, like unmistakable\
  \ gunfire, unmistakably.\u201D\n\u201CThat was about 11:20 when we heard the shots\
  \ and the screams\u2026 at that point you could hear and see the screams and see\
  \ hundreds of people coming towards us.\u201D\nAmazingly, as Shepard Ambellas noted,\
  \ \u201CThe man\u2019s claims match up to actual events captured in police audio\
  \ recordings from the night of the shooting which confirms that between 11:15 and\
  \ 11:18 p.m. on the night of Oct. 1 there was, in fact, something going on at the\
  \ Bellagio.\u201D\nThis testimony also backs up claims by another eyewitness, Rene\
  \ Downs, who has spent the past few days doing interviews about a shooter inside\
  \ the Bellagio Hotel.\nSlowly but surely we are starting to see the official narrative\
  \ regarding the Las Vegas Massacre be completely destroyed.\nAt this point it is\
  \ strikingly obvious that authorities have lied to the American peopleabout the\
  \ worst mass shooting in our countries history.\nOne can only speculate as to what\
  \ the reasons for these lies actually are?\n```\noutput:\n```\n{ \n  \"annotations\"\

  \ Is Exploding in Trump\u2019s FaceThe president is doubling down on an increasingly\
  \ risky candidate.\nJustice Anthony Kennedy gave President Donald Trump the biggest\
  \ political gift possible when he announced his resignation in the spring.\nEven\
  \ though not everything that\u2019s gone wrong is Trump\u2019s fault, he has managed\
  \ to make a complete hash of Brett Kavanaugh\u2019s nomination to fill the empty\
  \ seat on the court.\nIt\u2019s a good example of how badly Trump does his job more\
  \ than a year and a half into his administration. \n\nTo begin with, Trump has outsourced\
  \ his judicial nominations to outside, party-aligned groups, the Heritage Foundation\
  \ and the Federalist Society.\nThat included an unusually central role for the Federalist\
  \ Society\u2019s Leonard Leo.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t entirely a Trump mistake.\nHis\
  \ decision during the campaign to release a list of potential justices drafted by\
  \ Leo reflected the reality-TV star\u2019s weakness as a presidential candidate.\n\
  The party was worried that Trump might turn out not to be a conservative; to reassure\
  \ them, he publicly committed to their top goal.\nIn some ways, that\u2019s successful\
  \ coalition-building, and what he\u2019s done in office is just keeping his promises\
  \ on judges.\n\nStill, it\u2019s one thing to form an alliance with conservatives;\
  \ it\u2019s another to turn the whole process over to them.\nWe don\u2019t know\
  \ to what extent Kavanaugh was Trump\u2019s choice and to what extent he was manipulated\
  \ into choosing him.\nWe have plenty of evidence that Trump is easily manipulated\
  \ by those around him,and that Kavanaugh is a good fit for Trump\u2019s biases:\
  \ The judge has Ivy League credentials and he passes Trump\u2019s cut-of-his-jib\
  \ test by looking the part.\n1\n\nEither way, Kavanaugh was a poor choice from the\
  \ point of view of good presidenting.\nThe judge was certain to be a highly controversial\
  \ selection from the start.\nAfter all, he had been a highly controversial selection\
  \ for his current circuit court seat, eventually getting confirmed with only four\
  \ Democratic votes after a long delay.\nKavanaugh is a longtime Republican operative,\
  \ a hard-liner during both the Vince Foster and Monica Lewinsky investigations.\n\
  Nominating him, rather than a conservative with similar views but a different background,\
  \ was bound to stir up trouble.\nIt was also true, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch\
  \ McConnell reportedly warned, that normal disclosure of Kavanaugh\u2019s record,\
  \ especially his service during the George W. Bush administration, was going to\
  \ delay confirmation even more.\nSenate Republicans dealt with that problem by deciding\
  \ to not bother with any Kavanaugh documents that couldn\u2019t be produced rapidly,\
  \ which further riled up the Democrats and gave that party some good talking points.\n\
  2\n\n\nSometimes it\u2019s worth taking risks.\nPresidents who shy away from anything\
  \ that\u2019s not a sure thing can fail to exploit opportunities.\nIt\u2019s just\
  \ very hard to see any upside for Trump in choosing Kavanaugh instead of a safer,\
  \ but still very conservative, other option.\n3\n\nWhen serious charges of sexual\
  \ misconduct were raised against Kavanaugh, Trump decided to stick with him instead\
  \ of moving on to another candidate.\nIt\u2019s still not clear that Kavanaugh\u2019\
  s nomination is doomed, but it\u2019s certainly in severe trouble.\nLosing a high-profile\
  \ fight is always going to hurt a president, which is why they should take care\
  \ to avoid high-risk, low-reward conflicts.\nBut there\u2019s an art to minimizing\
  \ damage.\nAnd Trump hasn\u2019t learned it yet.For one thing, the president has\
  \ made this an extremely high-profile episode by stringing out the process as the\
  \ accusations against Kavanaugh gained credibility and even multiplied.\nWhether\
  \ that matters in terms of public opinion for Trump is unclear, but it certainly\
  \ isn\u2019t good for any Republican senators caught up in the middle, along with\
  \ any other candidates who have had to weigh in only to find the facts as they knew\
  \ them constantly changing. \n\nIt\u2019s also the case that the more negative information\
  \ comes out, the more it appears that the Trump and his White House staff failed\
  \ to do their jobs in vetting and managing Kavanaugh.\nIf the nomination had been\
  \ pulled right after Christine Blasey Ford made her initial assertions about Kavanaugh,\
  \ the public might have concluded that it wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s fault that a\
  \ previously unaired accusation came to light.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump\u2019s behavior\
  \ has been as erratic as ever.\nFirst he said that Brasey had to be heard; then\
  \ he attacked her in terms that were a slur on all women who have been assaulted\
  \ without immediately reporting it to the police, and he also blamed the Senate\
  \ for not voting before she came forward.\nHe sometimes praises Kavanaugh, but also\
  \ let it be known that he thought the nominee had performed badly in his Fox News\
  \ interview.\nThe White House demanded a final up and down vote on Tuesday; by Wednesday,\
  \ he was saying that the nomination would die if Kavanaugh didn\u2019t do well before\
  \ the Judiciary Committee on Thursday.\nThe sum of all this has been, as in many\
  \ other episodes, that Trump and his White House are a gang that can\u2019t shoot\
  \ straight and that he\u2019s eager to blame his allies and lash out at his enemies\
  \ in ugly ways when things go wrong.\n\nA botched nomination matters because allies\
  \ will be less likely to trust Trump, not just on Supreme Court choices, but on\
  \ any initiative.\nAnd, for that matter, they\u2019ll be less likely to trust him\
  \ when he asserts that there\u2019s nothing remaining for Special Counsel Robert\
  \ Mueller to reveal.\nTrump\u2019s professional reputation is already terrible,\
  \ but everything counts.\nAs the political scientist Richard Neustadt said, political\
  \ elites are constantly evaluating and re-evaluating the president.\nTrump is hurting\
  \ himself right now, and will have hurt himself more if Kavanaugh is not confirmed.\n\
  \nAnd yes, I call it the cut-of-his-jib test quite deliberately.\nIt's no surprise\
  \ that someone who hires based on what he thinks someone doing that job should look\
  \ like,which seems to be based on hazy old-time Hollywood casting,would wind up\
  \ with fewer women in his administration than any of his recent predecessors.\n\n\
  I've argued that too much disclosure is required, and that Democrats (and any wavering\
  \ Republicans) had more than enough information to make up their mind.\nI still\
  \ think that's true.\nBut it did leave Republicans vulnerable to claims about transparency\
  \ which were likely to be popular -- most people, and the entire press corps, love\
  \ transparency -- and vulnerable to bombshells in the documentary record which hadn't\
  \ been initially disclosed.\nIn the event, that's not what's causing the trouble,\
  \ but still it's an example of Trump taking needless risks.\n\nSome have speculated\
  \ that Kavanaugh would be especially likely to rule in Trump's favor if any cases\
  \ stemming from the Robert Mueller investigation wind up at the high court.\nPerhaps.\n\
  There are plenty of other partisan, conservative judges,and plenty of conservative\
  \ judges who lean towards an expansive view of presidential powers.\nAnd if Kavanaugh\
  \ is really an outlier on that issue, then he won't be in the majority on any future\
  \ decision anyway.\nSo, no, I don't think there's any good reason to think Kavanaugh\
  \ would be especially helpful to Trump compared to others he could have selected.\n\

  \ you, and dig through your personal life \u2014 without a warrant.\nOn multiple\
  \ occasions, Kavanaugh has been the lone voice when it comes supporting the state\u2019\
  s rights to warrantlessly spy on its citizens.\nAs Reason points out, in 2010 he\
  \ dissented from the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision not to rehear a case in which\
  \ a three-judge panel had ruled that police violated a suspected drug dealer\u2019\
  s Fourth Amendment rights when they tracked his movements for a month by attaching\
  \ a GPS device to his car without a warrant.\nKavanaugh claimed that putting a GPS\
  \ tracking device on a person\u2019s car without first obtaining a warrant was just\
  \ fine because it didn\u2019t constitute a \u201Csearch\u201D as defined by the\
  \ Fourth Amendment.\nTo Kavanaugh, bypassing the courts and tracking an individual\
  \ without their consent is \u201Cconstitutional.\u201D In this line of thinking,\
  \ the Fourth Amendment is not violated even if police trespass on someone\u2019\
  s physical property, or track someone\u2019s cell phone.\nLuckily, he was the only\
  \ judge on the panel to think this.\nIn June, the Supreme Court ruled specifically\
  \ on this case noting that collecting such information actually does constitute\
  \ a search and therefore requires a warrant.\nBut it gets worse.\nIn 2015, Kavanaugh\
  \ issued a statement strongly defending the NSA\u2019s phone metadata collection\
  \ program, arguing that it is \u201Centirely consistent with the Fourth Amendment.\u201D\
  \ To Kavanaugh, sweeping programs that collect information from innocent citizens\u2019\
  \ phones are not in conflict with having the right to be free from unlawful search\
  \ and seizure.\nSeriously.\nAccording to Kavanaugh, the Fourth Amendment allows\
  \ for searches \u201Cwithout individualized suspicion\u201D when the government\
  \ demonstrates a \u201Cspecial need\u201D that \u201Coutweighs the intrusion on\
  \ individual liberty.\u201D\nExactly what this \u201Cspecial need\u201D is that\
  \ can constitute a Gestapo like police state surveilling its own citizens is a moving\
  \ target that has already been proven to be abused over and over again.\n\u201C\
  The sacrifice of our personal liberty for security is and will forever be a false\
  \ choice,\u201D Senator Rand Paul said of Kavanaugh\u2019s views on the disposable\
  \ nature of the constitution.\nKavanaugh \u201Chas no qualms about applying decades-old\
  \ case law to the digital age, and he has endorsed the idea of a \u201Ccounterterrorism\
  \ exception\u201D to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement,\u201D said\
  \ Liza Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center for Justice\u2019s Liberty and\
  \ National Security Program.\nWhile the left is calling for Kavanaugh to be executed\
  \ over the sex abuse allegations and the right is attacking the alleged victims,\
  \ others in Congress who see through the facade and media distraction are trying\
  \ to draw attention to the fact that Kavanaugh is a champion of the police and surveillance\
  \ state and an enemy to privacy.\nRepresentative Justin Amash does not have a vote\
  \ on whether or not Kavanaugh will be appointed.\nHowever, this hasn\u2019t prevented\
  \ him from becoming the only Republican to speak out against the real reasons he\
  \ should not be appointed to Supreme Court.\n\u201CPrivacy advocates must fight,\u201D\
  Amash tweeted.\n\u201CThere are many potential nominees with a conservative record\
