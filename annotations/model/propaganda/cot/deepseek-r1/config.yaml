- name: Appeal_to_Authority
  description: 'Stating that a claim is true simply because a valid authority or expert
    on the issue said it was true, without any other supporting evidence offered.
    We consider the special case in which the reference is not an authority or an
    expert in this technique, altough it is referred to as Testimonial in literature.    Example
    1: "Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert
    in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it''s true."    Explanation:
    Richard Dawkins certainly knows about evolution, and he can confidently tell us
    that it is true, but that doesn''t make it true. What makes it true is the preponderance
    of evidence for the theory.    Example 2: "According to Serena Williams, our foreign
    policy is the best on Earth. So we are in the right direction." Details: since
    there is a chance that any authority can be wrong, it is reasonable to defer to
    an authority to support a claim, but the authority should not be the only justification
    to accept the claim, otherwise the Appeal-to-Authority fallacy is committed.'

  description: "Presenting two alternative options as the only possibilities, when\

  description: 'Assuming a single cause or reason when there are actually multiple

    Trump has been in office for a month and gas prices have been skyrocketing. The
    rise in gas prices is because of President Trump."    Example 2: "The reason New
    Orleans was hit so hard with the hurricane was because of all the immoral people
    who live there."    Explanation: This was an actual argument seen in the months
    that followed hurricane Katrina. Ignoring the validity of the claims being made,
    the arguer is blaming a natural disaster on a group of people.    Example 3: "If
    France had not have declared war on Germany then world war two would have never
