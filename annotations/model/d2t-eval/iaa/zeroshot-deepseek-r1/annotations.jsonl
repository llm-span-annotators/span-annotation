The data confirms this event, so that's correct.\n\nThen, F. Domínguez scored in the 34th minute, assisted by Lenny Lobato. Looking at the events, yes, that goal is listed, so accurate.\n\nThe text mentions Luiz Felipe getting a red card in the 24th minute. The data shows this event as well, so no problem here.\n\nIn the second half, Rafael Thyere scored in the 48th minute with an assist from Chico. Wait, the data says Rafael Thyere's goal was assisted by Chico, but the text doesn't mention the assist. However, since the text only states the time and scorer, it's not incorrect, just missing info. But according to the guidelines, if it's technically true but leaves out important context, it might be misleading. Hmm.\n\nThen, Fabinho scored in the 85th minute, assisted by Lucas Lima.

Referee Rafael Rodrigo Klein is correctly noted.\n\nWait, looking back at Rafael Thyere's goal: the text says \"Rafael Thyere scored in the 48th minute,\" but it doesn't mention the assist.

Looking at the data for Monday, each time slot shows cloud cover: 47%, 95%, 91%, 22%. None of these are 100% or 'overcast', which is typically above 90%. So the mention of \"overcast\" might be incorrect.\n\nNext, the text states that on Tuesday and Wednesday, there are predominantly clear skies. Checking the data for those days: Tuesday has cloud covers at 3%, 45%, and 2%, which does support clear skies. However, Wednesday starts with 0% clouds but later goes up to 42%. The text says \"predominantly clear,\" which might be misleading because part of Wednesday isn't clear.\n\nThen, the text mentions Thursday's temperature peaking at 11.68°C. Looking at Thursday's data points: 1.97°C, 1.1°C, and 9.17°C. The highest is 9.17°C, so 11.68°C seems too high and not supported by the data.\n\nLastly, Friday's text says temperatures reach up to 10.93°C. Checking Friday's data: the temps are around 1.52°C, 1.21°C, 9.01°C, and 4.21°C.

There's no data point that reaches exactly 2.41 m/s on Monday, so this seems incorrect.\n\nNext, Tuesday's part says temperatures go from 3°C to around 10.14°C. The data shows a high of 13.66°C at noon, which is higher than stated. So the text underestimates the temperature, making it misleading.\n\nOn Wednesday, the text mentions wind speeds varying between 75 to 307 degrees per hour. Wind direction is in degrees, not speed. This is confusing and incorrect because it's mixing direction with speed, so this is an 'Other' error.\n\nThursday's description says wind gusts up to 0.95 m/s by evening. The data shows a higher gust of 1.82 m/s at 12:00, but in the evening (18:00), the gust is only 0.92 m/s. So stating 0.95 might be acceptable if rounded, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's okay.\n\nFriday's text mentions wind speeds up to 2.77 m/s by afternoon. The data shows a speed of 3.84 m/s at noon, which is higher than stated.

So, Monday's wind speed doesn't match any data point, making it not checkable. Tuesday's temperature is lower than actual, so misleading.

Looking at the data, Rafael Thyere scored at 48' (which is just after halftime) and Fabinho at 85'. Both are indeed in the second half, so this part checks out.\n\nHowever, I notice that the text doesn't mention the fourth goal. The data shows four goals: two in the first half (7',34') and two in the second (48',85'). The text only accounts for three goals—two in the first half and two in the second—but wait, no, it says \"added two more,\" which would make it four total.

So that's correct.\n\nWait, but looking again, the text says Sport Recife added two more in the second half, which would make it four total. That's accurate because the halftime score was 2-0, and they scored twice more. So no error there.\n\nI also check for any contradictory or misleading information. The red card is correctly noted as impacting Ponte Preta's chances, which makes sense.

That's correct according to the data.\n\nNext, it says Sport Recife won 4-0. The data shows goals: home (Ponte Preta) 0, away (Sport Recife) 4. So that part is accurate.\n\nThen, the text talks about Chrystian Barletta scoring two goals and assisting another before being substituted at 61'. Looking at the events in the data:\n\n- At 7', Chrystian Barletta scored a goal.\n- At 85', Fabinho scored, but I don't see another goal from Chrystian. Wait, actually, checking again: the events list shows two goals by Sport Recife players. Let me recount.\n\nWait, in the data's 'events' array:\n\n1. 7': Chrystian Barletta (Sport) scores.\n2. 34': F. Domínguez (Sport) scores.\n3. 48': Rafael Thyere (Sport) scores.\n4. 85': Fabinho (Sport) scores.\n\nSo, Sport Recife scored four goals in total, but Chrystian Barletta only scored once at 7'. The text says he scored two goals and assisted another. That's incorrect because according to the data, he only scored once. So that's a mistake.\n\nMoving on: \"Felipe also contributed to his team’s early success by scoring in extra time as well.\" Looking through the events, I don't see Felipe scoring any goals. The scorers are Chrystian Barletta, F. Domínguez, Rafael Thyere, and Fabinho. So this is an error; Felipe didn't score.\n\nNext part: \"During the match, several substitutions were made on both sides; Ponte Preta had four changes with Igor Inocencio making multiple entries and exits from the field of play.\" The data shows that Ponte Preta made substitutions at 38', 46', 66', and 77'. That's four substitutions. However, Igor Inocencio was substituted in at 46' (substitution 2) but I don't see him making multiple entries/exits. Each substitution is a single entry or exit, so saying he made multiple might be misleading.\n\nThen: \"Notably, Sport Recife's F. Domínguez received a red card at the 24', while two yellow cards occurred for players Iago Inocencio and Hudson on behalf of Ponte Preta respectively in different substitution periods throughout the game.\" Checking the data:\n\n- At 24': Luiz Felipe (Ponte Preta) got a red card.\n- F. Domínguez didn't receive a red card; he scored at 34' and was substituted out later.\n\nSo, the text incorrectly states that F. Domínguez received a red card. Also, Iago Inocencio isn't in the data; it's Igor Inocencio who got a yellow card at 40'. Hudson also got a yellow at 89'.\n\nLastly: \"The match concluded after full-time with no additional penalties, finishing early due to Sport Recife's substantial lead as indicated by the status 'Match Finished'.\" The data shows the status is 'Match Finished', and there were no extra times or penalties. So that part is correct.\n\nNow, classifying these errors:\n\n1. Chrystian Barletta scoring two goals: This contradicts the data where he only scored once. So this is a Contradictory error (type 0).\n\n2. Felipe scoring in extra time: There's no record of Felipe scoring, so this is also Contradictory (type 0).\n\n3. Igor Inocencio making multiple entries/exits: The text implies he was subbed in and out multiple times, but data shows only one substitution for him. This could be Misleading (type 2) because it gives the wrong impression of his involvement.\n\n4. F. Domínguez receiving a red card: He didn't; it was Luiz Felipe who did. So this is Contradictory (type 0).\n\n5. Mentioning Iago Inocencio: The correct name is Igor, so this is an error but falls under 'Other' since it's a factual mistake not covered by other types.\n\nI need to make sure each annotation includes the reason, text span, and type.
