The SIM type is mini-SIM, which matches too.\n\nThe phonebook capacity is 150, which the text accurately reflects. Now, looking at the display section: the main display is TFT with 65K colors and resolution 128x160 pixels. The text says \"TFT screen capable of displaying 65K colors\" which is correct. However, it mentions \"dimensions that are unspecified,\" but in the data under 'Display', size is an empty string, so that's accurate.\n\nThe text also states there's no external display, but according to the data, there's a second external FSTN monochrome display with 96x64 pixels and screensavers. The text says \"does not have an external display,\" which contradicts the data. So this is a contradictory error because it denies the existence of a feature that's actually present.\n\nMoving on, messaging services are correctly noted as SMS and MMS. Java games up to four are correct. Language is English, and WAP browser version 1.2.1 matches the data.\n\nThe text mentions \"Polyphonic ringtones supported by the vibration alert system,\" which aligns with the data that has 'Vibration; Polyphonic ringtones, composer' under Sound.

Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the text carefully:\n\n\"In a thrilling Serie B match at the Estádio Onésio Brasileiro Alvarenga in Goiânia, Ituano edged out Vila Nova with a 4-3 victory. The first half ended in a 2-2 draw, with goals from José Aldo and Leozinho for Ituano, and Alesson and Luciano Naninho for Vila Nova. In the second half, Jemmes scored for Vila Nova, but Ituano responded with goals from Salatiel and Vinícius Paiva, the latter coming in stoppage time. The game saw numerous substitutions and yellow cards, with both teams displaying aggressive play. A VAR decision in the 90th minute disallowed a goal for Ituano due to offside, but they still secured the win.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare this text against the data provided.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- **League and Venue**: The match is indeed in Serie B at Estádio Onésio Brasileiro Alvarenga. So that part checks out.\n\n- **Score**: The final score is Ituano 4, Vila Nova 3. The text says 4-3, which matches.\n\n- **First Half Goals**:\n- Data shows goals by José Aldo (6'), Alesson (18'), Luciano Naninho (34'), and Leozinho (37'). So the first half ended 2-2 as stated in the text.\n\n- **Second Half Goals**:\n- The data lists a goal by Jemmes at 56' for Vila Nova, making it 3-2. Then Ituano scores at 84' via Salatiel and 90'+9' via Vinícius Paiva. So the text correctly mentions these goals.\n\n- **VAR Decision**: At 90'+2', there's a VAR decision disallowing a goal for offside, which is accurately described in the text.\n\nNow, checking for any discrepancies or errors:\n\n1. The text states that both teams displayed aggressive play because of numerous substitutions and yellow cards. Looking at the data, I count multiple substitutions (e.g., 41',46',50',61',71',72',75',81') and several yellow cards (52',54',59'(x2),64',65',76',80',87',90'+8', etc.). So it's factual that there were many substitutions and yellow cards, which can indicate aggressive play. However, the data doesn't explicitly state whether the play was aggressive; it just shows the events. Therefore, describing \"aggressive play\" might be subjective or not directly checkable from the data.\n\n2. The text mentions Salatiel scoring a goal for Ituano in the second half. Checking the data, I see that at 84', Salatiel assisted José Aldo's goal, but there's no record of Salatiel scoring himself. Wait, actually, looking again: At 84', the goal is by Salatiel, with assist from José Aldo. So the text correctly attributes the goal to Salatiel.\n\nWait, in the data under events, at time \"84'\", it's 'Salatiel' who scores for Ituano, assisted by José Aldo. So that part is correct.\n\nAnother point: The text says Vinícius Paiva scored in stoppage time, which aligns with 90'+9'. Correct.\n\nLooking again, the only potential issue I see is the mention of \"aggressive play.\" Since the data doesn't explicitly state that the teams were aggressive, just that there were many substitutions and yellow cards. So this could be a case where the text is making an inference beyond the data provided, which might not be checkable.\n\nSo, the error would fall under category 1: Not checkable because it's subjective or inferred without explicit data support.", "annotator_group": 0}

Williams equalized again for Once Municipal with a goal in the 90+2 minute. Both teams made multiple substitutions throughout the game, with a total of 9 changes between them. The match ultimately ended in a tie after 90 minutes plus 5 minutes of extra time.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare this text against the data provided to spot any discrepancies or issues.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- The goals are correctly listed as 2-2.\n- The own goal by G. Córdoba is at 14', correct.\n- J. Williams scored in 31' and again in 90'+2, which matches the text.\n- Y. Delgadillo's penalty at 49' is accurate.\n\nNext, substitutions: The data shows each team made several substitutions. Let me count them:\n\nIsidro Metapán substitutions:\n- D. Cetré (56'), G. Stradella (56'), Diego Gregori (70'), Y. Delgadillo (70'), J. Amaya (85'). That's 5 substitutions.\n\nOnce Municipal substitutions:\n- A. Ortega (57'), J. Gil (57'), E. Gónzalez (65'), E. Vásquez (70'). That's 4 substitutions.\n\nTotal substitutions: 5 + 4 = 9, which matches the text stating \"a total of 9 changes between them.\" So that part is correct.\n\nNow, looking at the match duration:\n\nThe data shows 'status' with 'elapsed':90 and 'extra':5. The text mentions \"after 90 minutes plus 5 minutes of extra time.\" That seems accurate because extra time usually refers to stoppage time, not extra periods. However, sometimes people might interpret extra time as additional periods beyond regular time, but in football (soccer), extra time typically means the added stoppage time. So this could be misleading if someone thinks it's 5 minutes of extra time beyond the 90, which isn't standard. But I'm not sure if that's a common misunderstanding or not.\n\nWait, actually, in football, \"extra time\" usually refers to the additional periods after the 90 minutes, like two 15-minute halves. However, in this data, 'elapsed' is 90 and 'extra' is 5, which likely means 5 minutes of stoppage time added to the second half. So the text might be misleading by saying \"plus 5 minutes of extra time,\" implying it's beyond the regular 90, but actually, it's just stoppage time within the 90.\n\nSo that could be a Misleading annotation because it technically adds up (total match time is 95 minutes), but in reality, it's part of the same half. However, I'm not entirely certain if this is a common enough misunderstanding to warrant an annotation. Maybe it's better to note it as misleading since it might confuse readers about the actual structure.\n\nAnother point: The text says \"the match ultimately ended in a tie after 90 minutes plus 5 minutes of extra time.\" But according to the data, 'elapsed' is 90 and 'extra' is 5. So the total time played was 95 minutes, but in football, matches can have stoppage time added within each half. The term \"extra time\" might be misleading here because it's not referring to extra periods after the match but rather stoppage time.\n\nSo I think this part is misleading and should be annotated as such.", "annotator_group": 0}

That seems correct.\n\nNext, Coastal Spirit took the lead in the 40th minute with A. Steinwascher's goal. The data shows an event at \"40'\" by Coastal Spirit, so that's accurate.\n\nThe text says they maintained their advantage into halftime. Looking at the score, halftime was 0-1 in favor of Coastal Spirit, which is correct because home scored 0 and away 1 at halftime. So no issue here.\n\nThen, Birkenhead equalized in the 71st minute through M. Patterson. The data has a goal by M. Patterson at \"71'\" for Birkenhead, so that's accurate.\n\nThe text mentions M. Patterson scoring a decisive penalty in the 90th +6 minute. Checking the events, there's a goal at \"90' +6\" by M. Patterson, type 'Goal', detail 'Penalty'. So that part is correct.\n\nNow, substitutions: The text states Coastal Spirit made three changes and Birkenhead two. Looking at the data, Coastal Spirit has substitutions at 56', 81', and 81' again (that's three). Birkenhead has substitutions at 77' twice and one more? Wait, no, in the data, Birkenhead has events at 77' with two substitutions (Substitution 1 and Substitution 2), so that's two substitutions. So the text correctly states Coastal Spirit made three and Birkenhead two.\n\nThe referee is R. Greenbury, which matches the data. The match concluded after 90 minutes plus 7 added time, which aligns with 'elapsed': 90 and 'extra': 7 in the data.\n\nI don't see any contradictions or inaccuracies here.

However, the text mentions a high probability specifically on Wednesday and Thursday. But according to the data, precipitation starts on Wednesday night and continues through Thursday. So, maybe the text is accurate here because it's mentioning those two days when rain occurs.\n\n3. **Temperatures from 5°C to 9°C**: Checking the 'temp' values during the day (12:00 and 18:00 slots), temperatures range from about 5°C up to around 17°C on Monday at noon. Wait, that's higher than 9°C. So the text says 5-9°C, but data shows a high of nearly 18°C on Monday. That's contradictory because the temperature exceeds the stated range.\n\n4. **Scattered clouds on Friday**: The data for Friday (2025-02-07) at 18:00 shows scattered clouds, which matches the text. So that part is correct.\n\nNow, classifying each potential error:\n\n- The overcast claim might be misleading because it's not entirely accurate every day.\n- The temperature range is contradictory as it doesn't account for higher temps on Monday.\n\nI should create annotations for these two points.

The key points are:\n\n- **League**: Serie B in Brazil.\n- **Teams**: Home team is Vila Nova, away team is Ituano. Ituano won the game.\n- **Score**: Vila Nova scored 3, Ituano scored 4.\n- **Events**: A list of events during the match, including goals, substitutions, and cards.\n\nNow, looking at the text to be annotated:\n\n\"The Ituano team won 4-3 against Vila Nova in a match played on November 17th, 2024. Ituano scored four goals throughout the game, with Leozinho and Salatiel contributing to their victory. Vila Nova fought back with three goals from Luciano Naninho, Alesson, and Jemmes, but ultimately fell short.\"\n\nI need to check each sentence against the data.\n\n1. **First Sentence**: \"The Ituano team won 4-3 against Vila Nova in a match played on November 17th, 2024.\"\n- Data shows Ituano as the winner with a score of 4-3. The date is correct (November 17th, 2024). So this part seems accurate.\n\n2. **Second Sentence**: \"Ituano scored four goals throughout the game, with Leozinho and Salatiel contributing to their victory.\"\n- Checking the events data for Ituano's goals:\n- José Aldo at 6'\n- Leozinho at 37'\n- Salatiel at 84' (assist from José Aldo)\n- Vinícius Paiva at 90'+9'\n- So, Ituano scored four goals. The players mentioned are Leozinho and Salatiel, both of whom did score. However, the text says \"contributing to their victory,\" which is correct since they scored.\n\n3. **Third Sentence**: \"Vila Nova fought back with three goals from Luciano Naninho, Alesson, and Jemmes, but ultimately fell short.\"\n- Checking Vila Nova's goals:\n- Alesson at 18'\n- Luciano Naninho at 34' (assist from Alesson)\n- Jemmes at 56' (assist from Luciano Naninho)\n- So, three goals from these players. The text accurately reflects this.\n\nWait a minute, the data shows that Vila Nova scored three goals: Alesson (18'), Luciano Naninho (34'), and Jemmes (56'). The text correctly mentions all three scorers. However, looking at Ituano's goals, the text only mentions Leozinho and Salatiel but misses José Aldo and Vinícius Paiva.\n\nBut does this omission make the statement misleading? The sentence says \"with Leozinho and Salatiel contributing to their victory.\" Since both did contribute by scoring, it's technically correct. However, not mentioning the other two scorers might be seen as incomplete but not necessarily contradictory or misleading because it doesn't distort the fact that Ituano scored four goals.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The text states that Ituano scored four goals with contributions from Leozinho and Salatiel. Since both did score, this is accurate. The other two scorers are not mentioned, but their omission doesn't make the statement false or misleading because it's just highlighting some contributors, not all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the user intended to list all scorers but missed two, which could be an error of omission. However, according to the guidelines, if the fact is technically true but leaves out important information, it's considered Misleading (type 2). But in this case, the text doesn't claim exclusivity; it just mentions some contributors.\n\nWait, let me re-examine the sentence: \"Ituano scored four goals throughout the game, with Leozinho and Salatiel contributing to their victory.\" The use of \"with\" here might imply that these two were the main or only contributors. However, in reality, there were four scorers. So this could be misleading because it doesn't provide a complete picture, potentially giving the impression that only those two scored.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, if the fact is technically true but leaves out important information, it's Misleading (type 2). So perhaps the text is misleading by not mentioning all four scorers, thus distorting the context by under-representing the contributors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's acceptable because it's just highlighting some of them without implying exclusivity. The phrase \"with... contributing\" doesn't necessarily mean only those two. It could be interpreted as including others as well. So perhaps this isn't an error after all.\n\nWait, but in the data, Ituano had four goals from four different players: José Aldo (6'), Leozinho (37'), Salatiel (84'), and Vinícius Paiva (90'+9'). The text only mentions two of them. So by not mentioning the other two, it's incomplete but not necessarily misleading because it doesn't contradict any data; it just doesn't provide full information.\n\nHowever, according to the guidelines, if a fact is technically true but leaves out important info, it's Misleading (type 2). So perhaps this omission is significant enough to be considered misleading because it doesn't give the full picture of all contributors.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's not that serious. The text correctly states Ituano scored four goals and mentions two scorers. Since it doesn't claim exclusivity, it might not be misleading. But I'm a bit unsure here.\n\nWait, let me check the examples given in the problem statement:\n\n- Misleading: The tone suggests many sensors but only four exist.\n\nIn this case, the text's tone might suggest that Ituano had multiple scorers beyond just two, but by mentioning only two, it could be seen as leaving out important info. So perhaps it is misleading.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not, because it doesn't explicitly state that only those two scored. It just mentions them as contributors.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to see if there's any other error.\n\nLooking again at the text: \"Ituano scored four goals throughout the game, with Leozinho and Salatiel contributing to their victory.\"\n\nThe data shows that Ituano did score four goals, so the first part is correct. The second part mentions two contributors who indeed scored, but omits two others. So technically, it's true but incomplete.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, if a fact is technically true but leaves out important info, it's misleading (type 2). Therefore, this could be classified as Misleading because it doesn't mention all scorers, which might give an incomplete picture of how Ituano achieved their victory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe not. Because mentioning some contributors without implying exclusivity isn't necessarily misleading. The statement is still factually correct; it's just that more information exists beyond what's stated.\n\nI think the key here is whether omitting the other two scorers distorts the context or leaves out important info. Since the text doesn't claim to list all scorers, but only mentions some, perhaps it's not misleading. However, if the omission could change the understanding of how Ituano won (e.g., implying that only two players were responsible), then it might be misleading.\n\nIn this case, since four different players scored for Ituano, and the text only mentions two, it might understate the team effort, making it misleading. Therefore, I think this should be annotated as Misleading (type 2).\n\nSo, the error is in the second sentence where Ituano's goals are attributed only to Leozinho and Salatiel, omitting José Aldo and Vinícius Paiva.\n\nNow, let me structure the JSON output accordingly.", "annotator_group": 0}

Dossantos) and 53' (N. Fuson). There's no goal by C. Holstad. So this is incorrect; it should be N. Dossantos and N. Fuson.\n\nThird sentence: \"The match saw several yellow cards issued throughout the game, including one to Rhode Island's C. Holstad in the second half.\" The data shows that C. Holstad received a yellow card at 69', which is in the second half, so this part is correct.\n\nFourth sentence: \"Charleston Battery's lone goal was scored by J. Torres in the 61st minute.\" According to the data, J. Torres did score at 61', so that's accurate.\n\nLast sentence: \"The match concluded with a final score of 2-1 in favor of Rhode Island.\" This is correct as per the data.\n\nSo the main error is in the second sentence where C. Holstad is incorrectly mentioned as a scorer instead of N. Dossantos. Therefore, this is a Contradictory error because it directly contradicts the data.", "annotator_group": 0}

Orozco and J. Arteaga each scored two goals. Looking at the events in the data: O. Orozco scored at 25' and 47', which is two goals. However, J. Arteaga only scored once at 58'. The other scorers were R. Rodríguez (59'), M. Hernández (63'), and R. Carballo (77'). So the text incorrectly attributes two goals to J.

Isidro Metapán scored first with an own goal by G. Córdoba at the 14' mark, followed by J. Williams's goal for Once Municipal at the 31'. Isidro Metapán then took a 2-1 lead with Y. Delgadillo scoring on a penalty at the 49' mark. The match saw several substitutions from both teams throughout the game.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare each part of this text against the data provided.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- The league is Primera Division in El Salvador.\n- The teams are Isidro Metapán (home) and Once Municipal (away).\n- Both scored 2 goals each. So the scoreline is correct as 2-2.\n- Events:\n- At 14', G. Córdoba (Isidro Metapán) scored an own goal, so that's a goal for Once Municipal.\n- At 31', J. Williams (Once Municipal) scored a normal goal.\n- At 49', Y. Delgadillo (Isidro Metapán) scored a penalty.\n\nWait, the text says Isidro Metapán scored first with an own goal by G. Córdoba at 14'. But according to the data, that's an own goal, which means it's counted as a goal for Once Municipal, not Isidro Metapán. So in reality, Once Municipal scored first through that own goal.\n\nThe text incorrectly states that Isidro Metapán scored first when it was actually an own goal, meaning the goal went to Once Municipal. Therefore, this is a contradictory error because it contradicts the data.\n\nNext part: J. Williams's goal at 31' for Once Municipal is correct as per data.\n\nThen, Y. Delgadillo's penalty at 49' for Isidro Metapán is also correct.\n\nSo the mistake is in the first sentence where it says Isidro Metapán scored first with an own goal. That should be Once Municipal scoring via the own goal.\n\nTherefore, the error spans from \"Isidro Metapán scored first\" to \"at the 14' mark\". The reason is that the text contradicts the data by attributing the own goal to Isidro Metapán as their score instead of it being an own goal for Once Municipal.\n\nI don't see any other errors.

No issues here.\n\nNext, the second sentence states that Coastal Spirit scored in the 56th minute with a goal by A. Steinwascher, assisted by K. Hayashi. Checking the data's events:\n\n- At 40', Coastal Spirit scored through A. Steinwascher without an assist.\n- At 56', there was a substitution for Coastal Spirit: L. Cotter came on, assisted by K. Hayashi.\n\nSo here's a problem. The text says the goal was at 56' with an assist from K. Hayashi, but according to data, the goal was at 40' without an assist, and the substitution happened at 56'. Therefore, both the time and the assist are incorrect. This seems like a contradictory error because it directly contradicts the data.\n\nMoving on, the third sentence says Birkenhead United scored in 71st and 77th minutes through M. Patterson and D.

The next event is another substitution at 77' and then a penalty goal by M. Patterson in 90'+6.\n\nSo the text incorrectly states that D. Bunch scored at 77'. In reality, he was substituted in, not scoring. The actual second goal for Birkenhead was at 90'+6', which isn't mentioned here. This is another contradiction because it misattributes a goal to the wrong time and player.\n\nThe last sentence correctly states the final score as 2-1 in favor of Birkenhead United, matching the data's 'goals' section (home:2, away:1). So no issue there.\n\nNow, classifying these errors:\n\n1. The first error about the goal at 56' with assist is contradictory because it misstates both time and assist.\n2. The second error about D. Bunch scoring at 77' is also contradictory as he didn't score then; it was a substitution.\n\nI don't see any other issues in the text.

Wait, no, the main issue was the low temp being wrong.\n\nThen, wind speeds are mentioned as moderate with gusts up to 7.6 m/s. The data shows a max gust of 7.6 on Thursday evening, which matches, so that's correct.\n\nRain forecast on Thursday: the data does show rain on Thursday, so that part is accurate.\n\nLastly, Friday's cloud cover: the text says there may be scattered clouds and clearer skies by evening. The data for Friday evening shows 44% cloud cover, which aligns with scattered clouds, so that seems fine.\n\nSo the only error I found is the incorrect low temperature of 2°C instead of around 4°C.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me go through each part of the text step by step.\n\nFirst, the text mentions \"mostly overcast skies with cloud cover ranging from 77% to 100%.\" Looking at the data, most days have 100% cloud cover except Wednesday at 18:00, which is 77%. So that seems accurate. No error here.\n\nNext, it says there will be light rain showers intermittently, with precipitation between 0.89 mm and 3.63 mm. Checking the data, I see rain amounts like 1.46, 0.89, 1.76, 3.63, etc. So that's correct too.\n\nThe temperature range is stated as 24.6°C to 32.7°C. From the data, the lowest temp is 24.6 and the highest is 32.7. That matches exactly, so no issue there.\n\nWind speeds are mentioned from 0.4 m/s to 5.1 m/s. The data shows wind speeds varying, including a high of 5.1 m/s on Thursday at 06:00. So that's accurate as well.\n\nPressure levels are said to be around 1008-1011 hPa. Looking through the data points, pressure does stay within this range, so no problem here either.\n\nLastly, the text notes wind gusts up to 4.94 m/s. In the data, on Thursday at 06:00, there's a gust of 4.94 m/s. That seems correct.\n\nI don't see any contradictions or inaccuracies in the text based on the provided data.

Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the text mentions temperatures ranging from around 2 to 11°C. Looking at the data, the minimum temp is 2.08°C and max is 11.13°C. That seems accurate, so no issue there.\n\nNext, it says the first two days have consistent cloud cover. The data shows clouds at 100% on Monday and Tuesday morning, which matches. So that's correct.\n\nThen, Wednesday brings clear skies. Checking the data for Wednesday, at noon it's clear, but in the morning it's mist. The text mentions a brief period of clear skies, so that seems okay because there is a clear sky part on Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, the text says cloudy conditions return. The data shows clouds increasing again, so that checks out.\n\nFor Friday, the text mentions light rain with up to 1.38 mm. The data indeed has rain on Friday at 12:00 and 18:00, with 1.38 mm mentioned. So that's accurate.\n\nWind speeds are stated as varying from 2 to 8 m/s. Looking through the data, wind speeds go up to 8.23 m/s, so that range is correct.\n\nNow, checking for any errors. The text says \"the first two days will see consistent cloud cover.\" Wait, in the data, Tuesday (second day) has a point where clouds are at 95%, which is slightly less than 100%. So maybe it's not entirely consistent? But 95% is still mostly cloudy, so perhaps that's acceptable. I'm not sure if this is contradictory or just misleading.\n\nAnother point: The text mentions \"a chance of light rain\" on Friday. The data shows rain specifically at two times, but the text doesn't specify when, which might be a bit vague. However, it's still accurate as there is rain expected.\n\nI don't see any clear contradictions or checkable errors. All statements seem to align with the data provided.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the generated text carefully:\n\n\"Over the next five days, Santa Maria can expect a mix of rain and overcast clouds, with light to moderate rain showers occurring on multiple days. The first day will see light rain in the morning and evening, with temperatures ranging from 26 to 29 degrees Celsius. As the week progresses, Wednesday is expected to bring moderate rain, while Thursday and Friday will see a decrease in precipitation, with some periods of broken clouds and few clouds. Throughout the period, winds will be generally light, blowing at speeds of around 1-4 meters per second from varying directions. Temperatures are expected to remain relatively consistent, ranging from 24 to 30 degrees Celsius throughout the five-day period.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare each part with the data provided.\n\nLooking at the first sentence: It mentions a mix of rain and overcast clouds, which aligns with the data showing various weather conditions like light rain and overcast clouds on different days. So that seems accurate.\n\nNext, the text says \"light to moderate rain showers occurring on multiple days.\" Checking the data, I see that there are instances of both light rain (id 500) and moderate rain (id 501), so this is correct.\n\nThe first day's forecast mentions light rain in the morning and evening. The data for '2025-02-03' shows light rain at 00:00 and 06:00, but at 12:00 it's overcast clouds. So the text might be misleading because it implies rain both morning and evening, but according to the data, the evening (18:00) on the first day is also light rain. Wait, no—the first day is Monday, which has entries at 00:00, 06:00, 12:00, and 18:00. At 00:00 and 06:00 it's light rain, but at 12:00 it's overcast clouds, and at 18:00 it's light rain again. So the text says \"morning and evening,\" which would correspond to 06:00 and 18:00, both of which are light rain. So that part is accurate.\n\nThe temperature range for the first day is stated as 26-29°C. Looking at the data for Monday (2025-02-03), the temps are around 26.68, 29.01, 26.75, and 25.7. Wait, the highest temp on that day is 29.01, which is within the range mentioned. The lowest is 25.7, but the text says \"ranging from 26 to 29,\" which doesn't include 25.7. That's a problem because it excludes the lower temperature. So this could be misleading as it doesn't capture the full range.\n\nMoving on, the text mentions Wednesday having moderate rain. Checking the data for Wednesday (2025-02-05), at 00:00 it's moderate rain with 2.01 mm, and other times are overcast or light rain. So that part is correct.\n\nThursday and Friday are said to have decreased precipitation with broken clouds and few clouds. Looking at Thursday (2025-02-06) data, there's light rain at 06:00 and overcast/broken clouds otherwise. Friday has mostly overcast or broken clouds with some light rain. So the decrease in precipitation is accurate.\n\nWind speeds are mentioned as 1-4 m/s. Checking various entries, wind speeds vary from around 0.41 up to 5.25 m/s. The text says \"around 1-4,\" which covers most of the data but doesn't include the higher gusts or lower speeds. However, since it's a general statement, it might be acceptable unless it's misleading.\n\nTemperature range in the text is 24-30°C. Looking at all the days, the lowest temp is around 24.47°C on Thursday, and the highest is 36.5°C on Tuesday (2025-02-04) at 06:00. Wait, that's a feels-like temperature of 36.5, but the actual temp is 29.5°C. The text refers to actual temperatures, so the high is 29.5, which is within 24-30. However, on Tuesday (2025-02-04) at 06:00, the feels-like is 36.5, but that's not the actual temp. So the text's temperature range seems accurate for actual temps.\n\nWait, no—the data shows 'temp' as the actual temperature. The highest 'temp' is 29.94 on Monday (12:00), and the lowest is 24.47 on Thursday (00:00). So the text says 24-30, which covers that range accurately.\n\nNow, looking for errors:\n\n1. The first day's temperature range in the text is 26-29°C, but according to data, it goes down to 25.7°C at 18:00. So the text doesn't include this lower temp, making the range incorrect. This could be misleading as it doesn't reflect the actual minimum.\n\n2. The wind speed mentioned is \"around 1-4 m/s,\" but in the data, there's a wind speed of 5.25 m/s on Monday at 06:00. So the text doesn't capture the maximum wind speed, which might be misleading as it suggests winds are lighter than they actually can be.\n\n3. The text states that Thursday and Friday have \"some periods of broken clouds and few clouds,\" but according to the data, Thursday has mostly overcast or broken clouds, and on Friday at 06:00, it's overcast, then broken clouds at 12:00, and overcast again at 18:00. There are also some few clouds on Friday at 00:00 (23 clouds). So the text is accurate in mentioning broken and few clouds.\n\nWait, but the data for Thursday (2025-02-06) shows clouds at 100% except at 12:00 which is 81%. So maybe the text's mention of \"broken clouds\" on Thursday is correct because at 12:00 it's 81%, which could be considered broken. However, the text says \"some periods,\" which aligns with that.\n\nSo focusing back on the two potential errors:\n\n- Temperature range on the first day not including the lower temp.\n- Wind speed maximum not captured.\n\nNow, classifying these:\n\n1. The temperature range error: The text says 26-29°C but data shows a low of 25.7°C. This is contradictory because it's stating a higher minimum than what's in the data. So this would be a Contradictory error (type 0).\n\n2. Wind speed maximum: The text says up to 4 m/s, but data has 5.25 m/s. Again, this is contradictory as it doesn't include the higher value.\n\nWait, but I need to check if these are actual errors or just minor discrepancies. For temperature, the feels-like was 36.01 on Monday at 06:00, but that's not the actual temp. The actual temps are within the text's range except for the first day's evening which is 25.7°C.\n\nSo the first error is in the temperature range of the first day, making it contradictory because it doesn't include the lower value.\n\nThe second error is about wind speed; the data shows a higher speed than mentioned, so that's also contradictory.\n\nWait, but looking back at the text: \"winds will be generally light, blowing at speeds of around 1-4 meters per second.\" The data has a wind speed of 5.25 m/s on Monday at 06:00. So the text is incorrect in stating the maximum wind speed, which is higher than 4 m/s.\n\nSo both these points are errors.\n\nNow, I need to structure this into JSON as per instructions.", "annotator_group": 0}

That seems like a contradictory error.\n\nNext sentence: \"Temperatures will remain relatively consistent, ranging from 24.49 to 31.3 degrees Celsius.\" Checking the data, the lowest temp is 24.49°C and the highest is indeed 31.3°C. So that part is accurate.\n\nThen, \"Light rain is expected on several days, including Wednesday and Thursday...\" The data shows light rain starting from Tuesday (2025-02-04) through Friday. So mentioning only Wednesday and Thursday misses Tuesday and Friday, making it misleading as it leaves out important info about the other days with rain.\n\nNext part: \"...with the highest amount of rainfall predicted for Thursday at 5 mm.\" Looking at the data, on Thursday at 12:00, there's 5mm of rain. That seems correct.\n\nThen, \"Wind speeds will also vary, with gusts reaching up to 12.76 meters per second on Friday.\" The data shows a wind gust of 12.76 m/s on Wednesday (2025-02-05 12:00) and another on Thursday. However, the text says it's on Friday, which is incorrect. So that's contradictory.\n\nLastly, \"Throughout the period, pressure will remain relatively stable, ranging from 1009 to 1012 hPa.\" The data shows pressure within this range, so no issue there.\n\nSo I identified two errors: one about cloud cover and another about wind gusts.

No mention of rain or snow, so no precipitation is correct.\n\nNext, temperatures: \"daytime highs up to 24°C and nighttime lows as low as 7°C.\" Checking the data, the highest temp is 24.78°C on Wednesday at 00:00, which rounds to 25°C, but the text says 24.

The match status is 'FT' with 90 minutes elapsed and 13 extra minutes, but those are stoppage times, not extra time. So this is a contradiction.\n\nNext, it mentions José Aldo scored the winner in added time. Checking the events, José Aldo did score at 84', which is within regular time, not added time. The goals in added time were by Salatiel (90'+9') and Vinícius Paiva (90'+12'), so this is misleading.\n\nThe text states Vila Nova had five substitutes and Ituano six, including two in extra time. From the data, both teams made five substitutions each, and there's no indication of extra time substitutions since the game didn't go into extra time. So this is contradictory.\n\nIt also mentions a red card given to Richard from Vila Nova and Leozinho from Ituano. The data only shows yellow cards for these players, not red. That's another contradiction.\n\nSo I have four errors: two contradictions about extra time and substitutions, one misleading about the winning goal, and one contradictory regarding red cards.", "annotator_group": 0}

So that part is correct.\n\nThen, the text mentions extra time with no additional goals. Looking at the data, 'extratime' shows both home and away as None, so that's accurate too.\n\nNow, moving on to substitutions. The text states that Napier City Rovers had five substitutes at 46', 61', 65' twice, and 78'. Let me check the data's events:\n\n- At 46': G. Andrew (Napier) substituted.\n- At 61': K. Gould (Auckland) substituted.\n- At 65': M. Chretien (Napier) and D. Manickum (Auckland).\n- At 78': Gerard Garriga (Auckland) substituted.\n\nWait, the text says Napier had substitutes at 46', 61', 65' twice, and 78'. But looking at the data:\n\n- 46' is correct for Napier.\n- 61' substitution was by Auckland, not Napier. So that's an error in the text; it incorrectly attributes a substitution to Napier when it was actually Auckland.\n- At 65', both teams made substitutions: Napier and Auckland each had one. The text says \"twice\" which might imply two substitutions for Napier at 65', but according to data, only one substitute (M. Chretien) came in for Napier at 65'. So that's another error.\n- Then the text mentions 78' substitution for Napier, but in reality, it was Auckland who substituted Gerard Garriga at 78'.\n\nSo the substitutions section is incorrect for Napier City Rovers.\n\nMoving on, the text says Auckland had four changes with players coming in at 61', 65', and mentions D. Manickum and M. Bevan among others. Checking data:\n\n- At 61': K. Gould substituted.\n- At 65': M. Bevan and D. Manickum both came in for Auckland, which is correct.\n- Then there's another substitution at 78' (Gerard Garriga) and 86' isn't mentioned here but in the text it's not included either.\n\nWait, the data shows that Auckland had substitutions at 61', 65' twice, 78', and 90'. Wait no, looking again:\n\nThe events list for substitutions includes:\n\n- 46': Napier\n- 61': Auckland (K. Gould)\n- 65': Napier (M. Chretien) and Auckland (D. Manickum)\n- 77': Napier (E. Richards)\n- 78': Auckland (Gerard Garriga)\n- 86': Napier twice (J. Annear and C. Emerson)\n- 90': Auckland's S. Ukich scored a goal.\n\nWait, the text says Auckland had four substitutions: at 61', 65' (twice), and 78'. That seems correct because:\n\n- 61': K. Gould\n- 65': D. Manickum and M. Bevan (so two substitutions)\n- 78': Gerard Garriga\n\nThat's a total of four substitutions for Auckland, which matches the data.\n\nBut wait, in the text, it says \"Auckland City also saw four changes with players coming in from minutes 61', 65', 'substituting D. Manickum and M. Bevan among others.\" So that seems correct because at 61' one sub, at 65' two subs (D. Manickum and M. Bevan), making it three substitutions by 65'. Then another at 78', totaling four.\n\nWait no, the text says \"from minutes 61', 65', 'substituting D. Manickum and M. Bevan among others.\" That might be a bit confusing because it's listing times but not clearly indicating that there were two substitutions at 65'. But I think that's more of a wording issue rather than an error.\n\nNow, the text mentions that Napier had substitutes at 46', 61', 65' twice, and 78'. From data:\n\n- 46': correct (G. Andrew)\n- 61': incorrect, it was Auckland\n- 65': only one substitution for Napier (M. Chretien), not two.\n- 78': incorrect, that was Auckland.\n\nSo the text incorrectly states that Napier had substitutions at 61' and 78', which actually belonged to Auckland. Also, it claims two substitutions at 65' for Napier when there was only one.\n\nTherefore, this part of the text is contradictory because it misrepresents the substitution times and teams.\n\nNext, the text concludes with S. Ukich scoring a goal at 90', leading to a 1-0 win for Auckland. That's correct as per the data.\n\nSo the main error lies in the substitution details for Napier City Rovers. The text incorrectly attributes substitutions at 61' and 78' to Napier, which were actually made by Auckland. Additionally, it claims two substitutions at 65' for Napier when only one occurred.\n\nThis is a contradictory error because the facts in the text directly oppose the data provided.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the data, the match is between Charleston Battery (home) and Rhode Island (away). The final score is 1-2 in favor of Rhode Island. So, the home team scored 1, away 2.\n\nNow, reading the text:\n\nThe game started with no goals until halftime when Rhode Island scored through N. Dossantos' own goal at 43'. That's correct as per data.\n\nThen it mentions substitutions involving Z. Herivaux and J. Williams entering for M. Doyle and C. Holstad. Wait, in the data, the substitution at 46' is J. Conway replacing someone, not Z. Herivaux or J. Williams. Also, looking through events, Rhode Island's first sub is at 72', where C. Holstad is replaced by J. Brito. So the text incorrectly states substitutions involving Z. Herivaux and J. Williams entering for M. Doyle and C. Holstad during halftime. That seems wrong.\n\nNext, in the second half, Charleston equalizes with N. Markanich at 52', which matches data. Then another goal from J. Torres at 61'. The text says this increased their lead to two goals, but wait, the score was 0-1 at halftime. After 52' and 61', it's 2-1 for Charleston? But according to data, fulltime is 1-2. So maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nWait, no: in the data, halftime score is home 0, away 1. Fulltime is home 1, away 2. So after halftime, Charleston scores once (61'), making it 1-1, then Rhode Island scores again at 53' (N. Fuson), so 1-2. But in the text, it says Charleston equalized and then took the lead to two goals, which contradicts data.\n\nSo that's a problem. The text incorrectly states that Charleston led 2-1 at halftime end, but actually, after 61', it was 1-1, and Rhode Island scored again making it 1-2.\n\nAlso, substitutions: in the text, it mentions J. Brito substituting C. Holstad at 76', which is correct as per data (event at 72'). But earlier substitution part seems wrong.\n\nAnother point: the text says the match concluded in fulltime extra time when Charleston maintained their lead after another substitution and ended up winning. Wait, no, according to data, the final score is 1-2, so Rhode Island won. The text incorrectly states that Charleston won despite Rhode Island's efforts.\n\nSo several errors here:\n\n1.

The match status is 'FT' with 90 minutes elapsed and 13 extra minutes, but those are stoppage times, not extra time. So this is a contradiction.\n\nNext, it mentions José Aldo scored the winner in added time. Checking the events, José Aldo did score at 84', which is within regular time, not added time. The goals in added time were by Salatiel (90'+9') and Vinícius Paiva (90'+12'), so this is misleading.\n\nThe text states Vila Nova had five substitutes and Ituano six, including two in extra time.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the text carefully and compare it with the data to spot any discrepancies or issues.\n\nThe text mentions that during halftime, Coastal Spirit equalized when A. Steinwascher scored. Looking at the data, the halftime score was 0-1 in favor of Coastal Spirit, so that part seems correct because A. Steinwascher did score a goal at 40'. However, the text says they \"managed to equalize,\" which might be misleading because it implies the score was tied, but actually, Coastal Spirit took the lead.\n\nNext, the text states that M. Patterson scored another normal goal in the second half, extending Birkenhead's lead. According to the data, M. Patterson scored at 71' with a normal goal and again at 90'+6 with a penalty. So, the first goal by Patterson was indeed a normal goal, but the text doesn't mention the penalty goal correctly. It says \"extended their lead,\" which is accurate for the 71' goal, so that part seems okay.\n\nThen, the text mentions substitutions by D. Bunch and C. Hughes for Birkenhead United as reinforcements. The data shows these substitutions happened at 77', which is correct. So no issue there.\n\nThe last part of the text talks about extra time where M. Patterson secured the win with a penalty after several substitutes. However, according to the data, the match status is 'Match Finished' with 'FT' (Full Time) and 90 minutes elapsed plus 7 extra minutes. There's no mention of extra time in the data; it seems the game ended in regular time with the final score at fulltime. The penalty goal by Patterson was scored at 90'+6, which is within the extended stoppage time but not an official extra time period.\n\nSo, the error here is that the text incorrectly refers to \"extra time\" when the data shows the match ended after 90 minutes plus stoppage time, not going into extra time. This is a Misleading error because it distorts the context by implying an extra time phase which didn't occur.\n\nI should classify this as annotation_type 2 (Misleading) with the text span mentioning \"extra time\" and the reason that there was no extra time played.", "annotator_group": 0}

Looking at the events, both players scored in the 18' and 34', which are indeed in the first half. So that's correct.\n\nThen, Ituano's José Aldo and Leozinho scored. From the data, José Aldo scored at 6' and Leozinho at 37'. Both are first-half goals as well. The text doesn't specify when they scored, just that they did. That seems fine.\n\nThe text also mentions Salatiel and Vinícius Paiva adding to Ituano's tally in the second half. Checking the events, I don't see any goals from Salatiel. However, Vinícius Paiva scored at 90'+9'. So there's a mistake here: Salatiel didn't score, but someone else did.\n\nAdditionally, the text says \"several substitutions and yellow cards,\" which is accurate as both teams had multiple substitutions and cards, especially in stoppage time.

Checking the events, yes, there's a goal at 90' by S. Ukich for Auckland City. So that part is correct.\n\nNow, looking at substitutions: the text states Napier made five and Auckland four. Let me count the substitutions from the data. For Napier (home), I see substitutions at 46', 65', 77', 86', and another at 86'. That's five substitutions. Auckland (away) has substitutions at 61', 65', 78', and 90'—wait, no, looking again: their substitutions are at 61', 65'(twice), and 78'. Wait, the data shows four substitutions for Auckland: 61', 65'(two in one minute?), but actually, each substitution is a separate event. So that's four substitutions (at 61', 65' twice, and 78'). Hmm, wait no—each 'subst' event counts as one substitution per player. Let me recount:\n\nNapier:\n- 46': G. Andrew\n- 65': M. Chretien\n- 77': E. Richards\n- 86': J. Annear\n- 86': C.

Dossantos in the 43rd minute. Checking the data, there's an event at \"43'\" where Rhode Island scored through an own goal by N. Dossantos. That looks accurate.\n\nThen, the text states that after halftime, Rhode Island extended their lead with a Normal Goal from N. Fuson assisted by C. Holstad in the 53rd minute.

Let me count the yellow cards in the data:\n\n- \"45' +3\": Rhode Island's Z. Herivaux (Yellow)\n- \"52'\": Charleston's N. Markanich (Yellow)\n- \"69'\": Rhode Island's C.

The scoring began with an own goal by G. Córdoba of Isidro Metapán in the 14th minute, followed by a goal from J.

Williams equalized again for Once Municipal with a goal in the 90+2 minute. Both teams made multiple substitutions throughout the game, with a total of 9 changes between them. The match ultimately ended in a tie after 90 minutes plus 5 minutes of extra time.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare this text against the data provided to spot any discrepancies or issues.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- The goals are correctly listed as 2-2.\n- The own goal by G. Córdoba is at 14', correct.\n- J. Williams scored in 31' and again in 90'+2, which matches the text.\n- Y. Delgadillo's penalty at 49' is accurate.\n\nNext, substitutions: The data shows each team made several substitutions. Let me count them:\n\nIsidro Metapán substitutions:\n- D. Cetré (56'), G. Stradella (56'), Diego Gregori (70'), Y. Delgadillo (70'), J. Amaya (85'). That's 5 substitutions.\n\nOnce Municipal substitutions:\n- A. Ortega (57'), J. Gil (57'), E. Gónzalez (65'), E. Vásquez (70'). That's 4 substitutions.\n\nTotal substitutions: 5 + 4 = 9, which matches the text stating \"a total of 9 changes between them.\" So that part is correct.\n\nNow, looking at the match duration:\n\nThe data shows 'status' with 'elapsed':90 and 'extra':5. The text mentions \"after 90 minutes plus 5 minutes of extra time.\" That seems accurate because extra time usually refers to stoppage time, not extra periods. However, sometimes people might interpret extra time as additional periods beyond regular time, but in football (soccer), extra time typically means the added stoppage time. So this could be misleading if someone thinks it's 5 minutes of extra time beyond the 90, which isn't standard. But I'm not sure if that's a common misunderstanding or not.\n\nWait, actually, in football, \"extra time\" usually refers to the additional periods after the 90 minutes, like two 15-minute halves. However, in this data, 'elapsed' is 90 and 'extra' is 5, which likely means 5 minutes of stoppage time added to the second half. So the text might be misleading by saying \"plus 5 minutes of extra time,\" implying it's beyond the regular 90, but actually, it's just stoppage time within the 90.\n\nSo that could be a Misleading annotation because it technically adds up (total match time is 95 minutes), but in reality, it's part of the same half. However, I'm not entirely certain if this is a common enough misunderstanding to warrant an annotation. Maybe it's better to note it as misleading since it might confuse readers about the actual structure.\n\nAnother point: The text says \"the match ultimately ended in a tie after 90 minutes plus 5 minutes of extra time.\" But according to the data, 'elapsed' is 90 and 'extra' is 5. So the total time played was 95 minutes, but in football, matches can have stoppage time added within each half. The term \"extra time\" might be misleading here because it's not referring to extra periods after the match but rather stoppage time.\n\nSo I think this part is misleading and should be annotated as such.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the generated text carefully:\n\n\"In Sampiro city for the upcoming week starting February 3rd to February 7th, cloud coverage will generally be high with occasional breaks of scattered and broken clouds throughout each day into Friday evening. Temperatures are expected to remain mild, ranging from a low of approximately 24.8°C on Wednesday at noon up to around 26°C during the afternoon hours across all days. Feels like temperatures will closely mirror actual air temperature due to high humidity levels and cloud cover, suggesting warm conditions despite overcast skies. Light rain is anticipated intermittently with rainfall amounts varying from none on some nights up to 5mm by Thursday afternoon before tapering off towards the weekend; light showers are expected at least three times during this period. Wind speeds will generally be moderate, ranging between 3m/s and 12.76m/s with occasional gusts up to speed of around 12.43m/s on Thursday afternoon. Pressure levels are relatively stable within the range of 1009-1012hPa, indicating consistent weather patterns without significant atmospheric pressure changes.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare each statement against the data provided.\n\n1. **Cloud Coverage**: The text says cloud coverage is generally high with occasional scattered and broken clouds. Looking at the data, most days have high cloud coverage (like 57%, 88%, etc.), but there are times when it's lower, such as 26% on Monday at noon. So this seems accurate.\n\n2. **Temperatures**: The text mentions a low of ~24.8°C on Wednesday at noon and highs around 26°C. Checking the data:\n- On Wednesday at noon (2025-02-05 12:00:00), temp is 24.94°C, which rounds to 24.9 or 25°C.\n- The high of 26°C is consistent with Monday's 26.81°C and Tuesday's 31.3°C, but wait, the data shows a high on Tuesday at 06:00 of 31.3°C, which is higher than 26°C. So the text says temperatures range up to around 26°C, but according to data, it goes up to 31.3°C. That's a discrepancy.\n\n3. **Feels Like Temperatures**: The text states they mirror actual temps due to high humidity and cloud cover. Data shows feels_like varies, sometimes higher (like 38.3°C on Monday at 06:00) and lower (25.99°C on Wednesday). So the statement might be misleading because it suggests feels-like is close, but data shows variations.\n\n4. **Rainfall**: Text says light rain with amounts from none up to 5mm by Thursday afternoon. Data shows rain starts on Tuesday at 12:00 (0.55mm), then Wednesday at 00:00 (0.17mm), 06:00 (none?), 12:00 (1.88mm), etc., and on Thursday at 12:00, it's 5mm. So the maximum is correct, but the text says \"none on some nights,\" which might not be accurate because every entry after Tuesday has some rain.\n\n5. **Wind Speeds**: Text mentions between 3m/s and 12.76m/s with gusts up to ~12.43m/s. Data shows wind speeds vary, with a max gust of 12.43 on Thursday at noon. So this seems accurate.\n\n6. **Pressure Levels**: Text says 1009-1012hPa, which matches the data (pressure ranges from 1009 to 1012).\n\nNow, identifying errors:\n\n- The temperature range in the text is incorrect because it misses the higher temp of 31.3°C on Tuesday.\n- The feels-like statement is misleading as it doesn't mirror actual temps closely; there's significant variation.\n\nSo I'll classify these two points as errors: one contradictory (temp range) and one misleading (feels like).", "annotator_group": 0}

Looking at the data, I see that on those days, the maximum wind speed is around 5.23 m/s, not 7.5.
