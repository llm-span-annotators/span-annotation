From the data, José Aldo scored at 6', and Leozinho at 37'. Both are correct, so no issue here.\n\nThe text continues by mentioning Salatiel and Vinícius Paiva adding to Ituano's tally in the second half. Checking the events, I see that Salatiel didn't score; instead, José Aldo scored again at 84', and Vinícius Paiva scored at 90'+9'. So Salatiel isn't listed as a scorer. That means the text incorrectly attributes a goal to Salatiel.\n\nMoving on, the text notes substitutions and yellow cards, which are present in the data, so that's accurate.\n\nFinally, it mentions Ituano securing the win with four goals despite Vila Nova's effort. The score is correct, so no problem there.\n\nSo the only error I found is the mention of Salatiel scoring when he didn't.

Orozco scored in the 25th minute, which matches the data's first event. At halftime, the score was 1-0, which is accurate according to the 'halftime' scores in the data.\n\nIn the second half, the text states Diriangén added five more goals, making it six total. The data shows goals at 47', 58', 59', 63', and 77'. That's five additional goals after halftime, so that part is correct.\n\nLooking at the goal scorers: O. Orozco scored twice (25' and 47'), J. Arteaga at 58', R. Rodríguez at 59', M. Hernández at 63', and R. Carballo at 77'. The text lists all these players, so that's accurate.\n\nNow, the substitutions: the text says Jalapa made nine changes and Diriangén seven. Checking the data, I count five substitutions for Jalapa (at 32', 46'x2, 60', 67'x2) but wait, each substitution event is one change per team. So Jalapa has events at 32', 46'(sub1), another at same time (sub2), then two more at 60' and 67'. That's a total of five substitutions for Jalapa. Diriangén has substitutions at 46'(x2), 60'(x2), and 77'—wait, no, looking back: events are at 46'(two subs), 60'(three subs: J. Coronel, O. Orozco, R. Rodríguez). Wait, the data shows for Diriangén: at 46', two substitutions (E. Urroz and A. Reyes), then at 60', three more (J. Coronel, O. Orozco, R. Rodríguez). So that's five substitutions in total for Diriangén as well.\n\nWait, the text says Jalapa made nine substitutions and Diriangén seven. But according to the data, both teams have five substitutions each. The text is incorrect here because it states higher numbers than what's in the data. That seems like a clear error.\n\nSo the error is in the substitution counts: the text claims nine for Jalapa and seven for Diriangén, but the data shows five each.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the text carefully:\n\n\"Isidro Metapán and Once Municipal played to a 2-2 draw at Estadio Jorge Calero Suárez on November 17, 2024. The scoring began with an own goal by G. Córdoba of Isidro Metapán in the 14th minute, followed by a goal from J. Williams of Once Municipal in the 31st minute, leaving the score tied 1-1 at halftime. In the second half, Y. Delgadillo scored a penalty for Isidro Metapán in the 49th minute, but J. Williams equalized again for Once Municipal with a goal in the 90+2 minute. Both teams made multiple substitutions throughout the game, with a total of 9 changes between them. The match ultimately ended in a tie after 90 minutes plus 5 minutes of extra time.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare this text against the data provided to spot any discrepancies or issues.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- The league is Primera Division in El Salvador.\n- Teams: Isidro Metapán (home) and Once Municipal (away).\n- Goals: Home 2, Away 2.\n- Score breakdown:\n- Halftime: Home 1, Away 1.\n- Fulltime: Home 2, Away 2.\n- No extratime or penalties.\n- Events include goals at 14', 31', 49', and 90+2'.\n- Substitutions: Each team made several substitutions. Counting them:\n- Isidro Metapán: Substitutions at 56' (twice), 70' (twice), and 85'. That's 5 substitutions.\n- Once Municipal: Substitutions at 57' (twice) and 65', 70'. That's 4 substitutions.\n- Total substitutions: 9.\n\nNow, checking the text for errors:\n\n1. The text states that both teams made a total of 9 changes. According to the data, Isidro Metapán had 5 substitutions and Once Municipal had 4, totaling 9. So this part is correct.\n\n2. The match duration: The status shows 'elapsed':90 and 'extra':5. However, in football, extra time usually refers to a 30-minute period after fulltime, but here it's only 5 minutes. Wait, the data says 'status' has 'elapsed':90 and 'extra':5. So the game went into stoppage time (injury time), not extra time. The text mentions \"after 90 minutes plus 5 minutes of extra time,\" which might be misleading because in football terminology, extra time is different from stoppage time.\n\n3. Checking the goals: The own goal at 14', J. Williams at 31', Y. Delgadillo penalty at 49', and another J. Williams goal at 90+2'. That's correct as per data.\n\n4. The text says \"leaving the score tied 1-1 at halftime.\" According to the data, halftime scores were Home 1 (Isidro Metapán) and Away 1 (Once Municipal), so that's accurate.\n\n5. The final sentence mentions extra time, but in reality, it was stoppage time, not extra time. So this is a misleading statement because it implies an extended period beyond the regular 90 minutes, which wasn't the case here.\n\nSo the error is in the last part where \"extra time\" is mentioned. It should be \"stoppage time\" or just injury time. Therefore, the annotation type would be Misleading (2) because it's technically true that there were extra minutes but misrepresents the nature of those minutes as extra time rather than stoppage.\n\nI think that's the only error in the text.", "annotator_group": 0}

But on Tuesday, there's clear sky in the morning and scattered clouds later. So it's not entirely overcast every day. That seems contradictory.\n\nSecond sentence: \"high probability of precipitation on Wednesday and Thursday.\" Checking the data, Wednesday has rain only at 18:00 with 1.81 mm, which isn't a high amount. Thursday has more rain, especially in the morning and afternoon. So maybe Wednesday's precipitation isn't that high, making this statement misleading.\n\nThird sentence: Temperatures range from 5°C to 9°C during the day.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the text carefully:\n\n\"Bagakay will experience mostly overcast skies for the next five days with a chance of light rain on Wednesday and Friday. Temperatures will remain relatively cool, ranging from 24°C to 27°C during the day. Winds are expected to be moderate throughout the period, with gusts occasionally reaching up to 3 meters per second.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare each part of this text against the data provided.\n\n1. **Weather Conditions:**\nThe text mentions \"mostly overcast skies\" for five days and light rain on Wednesday and Friday. Looking at the data:\n- From Monday (2025-02-03) to Thursday (2025-02-06), most entries have cloud cover of 100% with descriptions like 'overcast clouds' or 'light rain'.\n- However, on Wednesday (2025-02-05), there's a period at 18:00 where clouds are 77%, described as 'broken clouds'. So, it's not entirely overcast every day. This means the text is misleading because it suggests mostly overcast skies when there's a significant period with less cloud cover.\n\n2. **Rain Days:**\nThe text states light rain on Wednesday and Friday. Checking the data:\n- Wednesday (2025-02-05) has 'light rain' at 06:00 but also other times with overcast clouds.\n- Friday (2025-02-07) doesn't have any rain mentioned; all entries are 'overcast clouds'. So, mentioning light rain on Friday is incorrect. This contradicts the data.\n\n3. **Temperature Range:**\nThe text says temperatures range from 24°C to 27°C during the day. Looking at the data:\n- Daytime temps (around 12:00) for each day are mostly around 26-30°C, but on Thursday (2025-02-06), it's 25.57°C, which is close to 24°C if rounded. However, the lowest temp in the data during the day is 24.6°C on Friday at 18:00, which isn't exactly daytime. So, stating 24°C might be misleading as the actual low during the period is around 25°C.\n\n4. **Wind Gusts:**\nThe text mentions winds with gusts up to 3 m/s. Checking wind data:\n- Most days have wind speeds around 1-2 m/s, but on Thursday (2025-02-06) at 06:00, the wind speed is 5.1 m/s with a gust of 4.94 m/s. This is higher than what's stated in the text, so it's contradictory because the data shows a higher gust speed.\n\nNow, I'll classify each identified error:\n\n- **Overcast Skies:** The text claims mostly overcast, but there's a period with broken clouds. This is misleading (type 2).\n- **Rain on Friday:** Text says light rain, but data doesn't show any. Contradicts the data (type 0).\n- **Temperature Range:** The low end of 24°C isn't accurate based on the data. Misleading (type 2).\n- **Wind Gusts:** Data shows higher gusts than stated. Contradicts (type 0).\n\nI need to make sure each annotation is the longest possible span and only includes what's certain.", "annotator_group": 0}

So the text is incorrect because not all five days are overcast.

But it's not mentioned every day, so saying \"throughout\" might be misleading because it implies more frequent occurrences than what's actually in the data.\n\nThird sentence: Temperatures around 4-7°C during the day. The data shows temps like 4.12, 7.43, up to 11.13 on Tuesday. So 4-7 is too narrow and misses the higher temp on Tuesday. That's contradictory.\n\nFourth part about fog on Wednesday and Friday: Data shows fog on Wednesday morning but clear skies by afternoon. No fog mentioned for Friday in the data, so that's incorrect.\n\nLastly, wind speed between 3-8 mph with gusts up to 10.

So, it's not entirely accurate to say \"throughout the week\" since there are clearer days.\n\nNext, temperatures are stated to hover around 25-26°C during the day. Checking the data, daytime temps on Monday are around 26.68°C, Tuesday around 27.39°C, Wednesday about 26.03°C, Thursday 25.39°C, and Friday 26.73°C. These all fall within 25-26°C, so that part seems correct.\n\nThe text mentions a chance of showers on Wednesday and Friday. From the data, Wednesday at 18:00 has overcast clouds without rain, but other times have light or moderate rain. Friday also has overcast clouds but no specific mention of showers beyond the general light rain. So, specifying Wednesday and Friday might be misleading because it's more consistent throughout the week.\n\nPrecipitation is described as moderate overall. The data shows varying rain amounts: 1.04 mm/h on Monday, up to 5.2 mm/h on Tuesday evening. This variation isn't captured by \"moderate,\" which could be misleading if some periods have heavier rain.\n\nPutting it all together, the text has a few inaccuracies.

This is a clear contradiction because the text incorrectly states that extra time decided the outcome.\n\nSo, I've identified two main issues:\n\n1. The statement about M. Patterson extending the lead is contradictory because his goal actually tied the game.\n2. The claim that the match ended in extra time with a penalty is incorrect; it was during stoppage time.\n\nI need to classify these errors. The first seems like a contradiction (type 0), and the second is also a contradiction but more about misrepresenting the phase of the game, so maybe another type? Wait, no—both are contradictions because they directly oppose the data.\n\nWait, actually, the second error could be considered contradictory as well since it's stating extra time when there wasn't any. So both annotations would have type 0.", "annotator_group": 0}

The match concluded with a final score of 2-1 in favor of Rhode Island.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare each sentence against the data provided.\n\n1. \"The Rhode Island team defeated Charleston Battery with a final score of 2-1.\"\n- Data shows 'goals': {'home': 1, 'away': 2}, so the score is correct. No error here.\n\n2. \"Rhode Island's goals were scored by N. Fuson and C. Holstad.\"\n- Looking at the events, Rhode Island's goals:\n- At 43', it's an own goal by N. Dossantos (Charleston Battery player), so that's one goal.\n- At 53', N. Fuson scores a normal goal.\n- I don't see C. Holstad scoring any goal; he did receive a yellow card but didn't score. So this is incorrect.\n\n3. \"The match saw several yellow cards issued throughout the game, including one to Rhode Island's C. Holstad in the second half.\"\n- Data shows multiple yellow cards, including to C. Holstad at 69', which is in the second half. Correct.\n\n4. \"Charleston Battery's lone goal was scored by J.

Correct.\n\n5. \"The match concluded with a final score of 2-1 in favor of Rhode Island.\"\n- Same as first sentence; correct.\n\nSo the error is in the second sentence where it incorrectly attributes a goal to C. Holstad. The text says both N. Fuson and C. Holstad scored, but data shows only N. Fuson scored, with an own goal from Charleston's player.\n\nNow, classifying this error:\n- It's not contradictory because the score is correct.\n- It's checkable since we can verify the scorers.\n- The statement is misleading because it includes an incorrect scorer, distorting the context by adding false information.\n\nTherefore, annotation_type should be 2: Misleading.\n\nThe span to annotate is \"N.

Looking at the data, under 'goals', both home (Isidro Metapán) and away (Once Municipal) scored 2 each. The date is also correct as per 'datetime': \"2024-11-17\". So this part seems accurate.\n\nNext sentence: Isidro Metapán scored first with an own goal by G. Córdoba at 14'. Checking the events, the first event is indeed a goal by G. Córdoba for Isidro Metapán as an own goal at 14', so that's correct.\n\nThen, J. Williams scores for Once Municipal at 31'. The data shows this event as well, so no issue here.\n\nThe next part says Isidro took a 2-1 lead with Y. Delgadillo's penalty at 49'. Looking at the events, Y. Delgadillo did score a penalty at 49', which would make the score 2-1 in favor of Isidro Metapán since they had already scored once (the own goal). However, I notice that after this, there are more goals. Specifically, J. Williams scores again for Once Municipal at 90'+2, making it 2-2. So the text doesn't mention this second goal by Williams, which actually ties the game.\n\nTherefore, the error is that the text states Isidro Metapán took a 2-1 lead without mentioning that Once Municipal equalized later. This omission makes the fact misleading because it doesn't provide the full context of the final score, leading the reader to believe Isidro was ahead when in reality it ended in a draw.\n\nSo, the span \"Isidro Metapán then took a 2-1 lead with Y.

This contradicts the text's statement about generally high cloud coverage throughout each day. So this seems like a contradictory error.\n\nNext, the text states that temperatures range from approximately 24.8°C on Wednesday at noon up to around 26°C in the afternoons. Checking the data, on Wednesday at noon (2025-02-05 12:00:00), the temp is indeed 24.94°C, which rounds to about 25°C. However, the text says 24.8°C, which is slightly off but within an acceptable range if we consider rounding. Wait, no, actually, 24.94 is closer to 25°C than 24.8. So maybe that's a minor discrepancy, but perhaps it's not significant enough for an annotation since it's close.\n\nMoving on, the feels-like temperatures are said to mirror actual air temps due to high humidity and cloud cover. The data shows feels_like and temp are very similar each day, so this part seems accurate.\n\nRegarding rainfall, the text mentions light rain intermittently with amounts from none up to 5mm by Thursday afternoon. Looking at the data, on Thursday at noon (2025-02-06 12:00:00), the rain is exactly 5mm. However, I also see that on Wednesday at 6 AM (2025-02-05 06:00:00), there's no rain mentioned, but other times have varying amounts. The text says \"none on some nights,\" which might be misleading because while some periods have no rain, others do.

So no issues there.\n\nNext, the first half ended 2-2. Checking the events, both teams scored two goals each in the first half, so that's accurate.\n\nLooking at the second half description: It mentions Jemmes scoring for Vila Nova, which is correct as per the data (56' goal). Then it says Ituano responded with Salatiel and Vinícius Paiva. Wait, in the data, Salatiel didn't score; he made an assist. The goals were from Leozinho at 37', José Aldo at 6', another by Salatiel? No, looking back, the goals for Ituano are at 6' (José Aldo), 37' (Leozinho), 84' (Salatiel), and 90'+9' (Vinícius Paiva). So in the second half, Ituano scored two more goals: Salatiel at 84' and Vinícius Paiva in stoppage time. The text correctly mentions these.\n\nWait, but the text says \"responded with goals from Salatiel and Vinícius Paiva.\" That's correct because after Jemmes' goal (56'), Ituano scored at 84' and 90'+9'. So that part is accurate.\n\nNow, the VAR decision: The text states it disallowed a goal for Ituano in the 90th minute. Checking the data, there's an event at 90'+2' where Marcelo Mineiro had a Var decision disallowing a goal due to offside. That's correct, so no error here.\n\nWait, but looking again: The text says \"a VAR decision in the 90th minute disallowed a goal for Ituano.\" However, the data shows this happened at 90'+2', which is in stoppage time, not exactly the 90th minute. So technically, it's slightly misleading because it wasn't during the 90th minute but after. But I'm not sure if that's a significant error or just a minor timing detail.\n\nOther points: The text mentions numerous substitutions and yellow cards, which is true as both teams had multiple subs and cards. No issues there.\n\nWait another thing: In the data, Salatiel scored at 84', but in the text, it says \"Salatiel and Vinícius Paiva.\" So that's correct because both scored in the second half after Jemmes' goal.\n\nI think I might have missed something earlier. Let me check again. The text states Ituano responded with goals from Salatiel and Vinícius Paiva, but according to the data, after Jemmes' 56' goal, Ituano scored at 84' (Salatiel) and 90'+9' (Vinícius). So that's accurate.\n\nWait, no. The text says \"responded with goals from Salatiel and Vinícius Paiva.\" But in reality, after Jemmes' goal, Ituano scored two more: one at 84' and another in stoppage time. So the text correctly mentions both scorers. Therefore, that part is accurate.\n\nWait, but looking back, I think I made a mistake earlier. The data shows that Salatiel didn't score; he assisted. Wait no, checking again: At 84', Ituano's goal was by Salatiel, assisted by José Aldo. So yes, Salatiel did score. Then Vinícius Paiva scored at 90'+9'. So the text correctly mentions both.\n\nWait, but in the data, the events list shows that at 84', Salatiel scored a normal goal, so that's correct. Therefore, the text is accurate there.\n\nSo perhaps I was overcomplicating it earlier. Maybe there are no errors after all. Let me check each part again:\n\n- Match result: Correct.\n- First half goals and scorers: Correct.\n- Second half: Jemmes scored for Vila Nova at 56', then Ituano's Salatiel at 84' and Vinícius Paiva in stoppage time. The text correctly states this.\n- VAR decision: At 90'+2', which is after the 90th minute, but the text says \"in the 90th minute.\" That might be a minor error because it's technically in extra time.\n\nBut considering that the match's total time includes stoppage time as part of the same minute count, maybe it's acceptable. However, strictly speaking, the VAR decision was at 90'+2', which is beyond the regular 90 minutes. So the text might be misleading by saying \"in the 90th minute.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the author intended to say that the VAR decision occurred in stoppage time but phrased it as the 90th minute for simplicity. I'm not sure if this counts as an error or just a minor inaccuracy.\n\nOther than that, everything else seems correct. So maybe there's only one potential error regarding the timing of the VAR decision.", "annotator_group": 0}

Ukich, so that's correct.\n\nFourth sentence: \"...Napier City Rovers making five changes and Auckland City making four.\" Looking at the events, Napier made substitutions at 46',65',77',86',86' – that's five substitutions. Auckland made subs at 61',65',78',90' – wait, that's four substitutions. So the text says both made several substitutions with Napier making five and Auckland four. That matches the data.\n\nFifth sentence: \"The match was officiated by referee M. Roil...\" Data shows referee as M. Roil, correct.\n\nSixth sentence: \"...concluded after 90 minutes of regular time.\" The status shows 'elapsed':90, so that's accurate.\n\nWait, but in the fourth sentence, the text says both teams made substitutions, with Napier making five and Auckland four. Let me recount the events:\n\nNapier substitutions:\n- 46' (Substitution 1)\n- 65' (Substitution 2)\n- 77' (Substitution 3)\n- 86' (Substitution 4)\n- 86' (Substitution 5) – that's five.\n\nAuckland substitutions:\n- 61' (Substitution 1)\n- 65' (Substitution 2)\n- 78' (Substitution 3)\n- 90' (Substitution 4) – that's four. So the text is correct here.\n\nWait, but in the data, Auckland has a substitution at 65' as Substitution 3? Let me check:\n\nLooking back: The events list shows for Auckland:\n- 61': Substitution 1\n- 65': Substitution 2 (player M. Bevan)\n- 78': Substitution 4 (Gerard Garriga)\nWait, no, the detail says 'Substitution 1', 'Substitution 2', etc.\n\nWait, in the data:\n\nAuckland substitutions:\n1. 61' – Substitution 1\n2. 65' – Substitution 2\n3. 78' – Substitution 4? Wait, that's inconsistent. Because after two subs, the next should be Substitution 3, but it says 'Substitution 4'. That might be a data error.\n\nWait, looking at the events:\n\nFor Auckland:\n- 61': detail: Substitution 1\n- 65': detail: Substitution 2\n- 78': detail: Substitution 4\n- 90': detail: Normal Goal (not substitution)\n\nWait, that's odd. So in the data, Auckland made substitutions at 61',65', and 78'. But the details say Substitution 1, 2, and 4. That skips Substitution 3. Maybe a typo? Or perhaps an error in the data.\n\nBut according to the text, it says Auckland made four substitutions. However, in the data, I count three substitutions for Auckland: at 61',65',78'. Unless there's another substitution I missed.\n\nWait, looking again:\n\nEvents list:\n- 61' – Substitution 1 (Auckland)\n- 65' – Substitution 2 (Auckland)\n- 78' – Substitution 4 (Auckland)\n\nSo that's three substitutions. But the text says four. So there might be a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted. Let me list all events:\n\n1. 46' – Napier sub 1\n2. 61' – Auckland sub 1\n3. 65' – Napier sub 2 and Auckland sub 2\n4. 77' – Napier sub 3\n5. 78' – Auckland sub 4? Wait, no, the event at 78' is for Auckland: player Gerard Garriga, substitution 4.\n\nWait, that's three substitutions for Auckland: 61',65',78'. So why does the text say four?\n\nAh, perhaps I missed one. Let me check again:\n\nLooking through all events:\n\n- 46': Napier sub1\n- 61': Auckland sub1\n- 65': Napier sub2 and Auckland sub2\n- 77': Napier sub3\n- 78': Auckland sub4 (Gerard Garriga)\nWait, that's four substitutions for Auckland? No, because at 78', it's substitution 4. So that would mean they made four substitutions: 61'(1),65'(2),78'(4). Wait, but where is substitution 3?\n\nLooking back, perhaps the data has an error in the substitution numbers. Because after two subs (at 61' and 65'), the next should be sub3, but it's labeled as sub4 at 78'. So maybe that's a mistake.\n\nBut according to the text, Auckland made four substitutions. The data shows three substitutions with incorrect numbering. Therefore, the text might have an error because it states four subs for Auckland, while the data only has three (with one misnumbered).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I missed another substitution event. Let me check all events:\n\nTotal of 10 events.\n\nLooking through each:\n\n1. 46' – Napier sub1\n2. 61' – Auckland sub1\n3. 65' – Napier sub2 and Auckland sub2\n4. 65' – Auckland sub3 (wait, no: the event at 65' for Auckland is substitution 2)\n5. Then 77': Napier sub3\n6. 78': Auckland sub4\n7. 86': Napier sub4 and sub5\n8. 90': Auckland goal\n\nSo in total, Auckland has substitutions at 61',65',78' – that's three substitutions, but the text says four.\n\nTherefore, the text incorrectly states that Auckland made four substitutions when they actually made three according to the data. So this is an error of type 1: Not checkable? Or perhaps contradictory?\n\nWait, no, because the data shows three subs for Auckland, but the text says four. That's a contradiction. So it's a Contradictory error (type 0).\n\nSo in the text, the sentence \"Napier City Rovers making five changes and Auckland City making four\" is incorrect regarding Auckland's substitutions.\n\nThus, I should annotate this span as an error.", "annotator_group": 0}

That's 4 substitutions.\n- Total substitutions: 9.\n\nNow, checking the text for errors:\n\n1. The text states that both teams made a total of 9 changes. According to the data, Isidro Metapán had 5 substitutions and Once Municipal had 4, totaling 9. So this part is correct.\n\n2. The match duration: The status shows 'elapsed':90 and 'extra':5. However, in football, extra time usually refers to a 30-minute period after fulltime, but here it's only 5 minutes. Wait, the data says 'status' has 'elapsed':90 and 'extra':5. So the game went into stoppage time (injury time), not extra time. The text mentions \"after 90 minutes plus 5 minutes of extra time,\" which might be misleading because in football terminology, extra time is different from stoppage time.\n\n3. Checking the goals: The own goal at 14', J. Williams at 31', Y. Delgadillo penalty at 49', and another J. Williams goal at 90+2'. That's correct as per data.\n\n4. The text says \"leaving the score tied 1-1 at halftime.\" According to the data, halftime scores were Home 1 (Isidro Metapán) and Away 1 (Once Municipal), so that's accurate.\n\n5. The final sentence mentions extra time, but in reality, it was stoppage time, not extra time. So this is a misleading statement because it implies an extended period beyond the regular 90 minutes, which wasn't the case here.\n\nSo the error is in the last part where \"extra time\" is mentioned.

That matches the data which says GSM 850/900/1800/1900 for both SIMs. So that part seems correct.\n\nNext, HSPA speeds: The text states up to 21.1/5.76 Mbps in the second slot. The data shows Speed as HSPA 21.1/5.76 Mbps, so this is accurate.\n\nNow, the device's dimensions and weight are correctly mentioned as per the data—117.8 x 63 x 11.7 mm and 98g.

Throughout the week, winds will blow from varying directions, with gusts reaching up to 4.94 m/s at times.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare each statement against the data provided.\n\nStarting with cloud cover: The text says it ranges from 77% to 100%. Looking at the data, most entries have 100% clouds except one on Wednesday at 18:00 which is 77%. So that seems accurate. No error here.\n\nNext, precipitation: The text mentions light rain showers with amounts between 0.89 mm and 3.63 mm. Checking the data, I see rain values like 1.46, 0.89, 1.76, 1, and 3.63 mm. So that's correct too.\n\nTemperature range is stated as 24.6°C to 32.7°C. The data shows minimum temp around 24.6°C (Thursday at 18:00) and max of 32.7°C on Monday at 06:00.

However, the text says \"gusts reaching up to 4.94 m/s,\" which is accurate because that's the highest gust recorded.\n\nWait, but looking again, in the data for Thursday at 06:00, wind speed is 5.1 m/s with a gust of 4.94 m/s. So the text correctly states the maximum gust as 4.94 m/s. Therefore, no error here either.\n\nI don't see any contradictions or inaccuracies based on the provided data.

Temperatures are expected to remain relatively consistent, ranging from 24 to 30 degrees Celsius throughout the five-day period.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare each part with the data provided.\n\nStarting with the first sentence: It mentions a mix of rain and overcast clouds over five days. Looking at the data, each day does have either rain or overcast clouds, so that seems accurate.\n\nNext, it says light to moderate showers on multiple days. The data shows varying amounts of rain, including 1.04 mm, 1.46 mm, up to 5.2 mm. So that's correct.\n\nThe first day (Monday) is said to have light rain morning and evening. Checking the data for Monday, there are two entries: one at 00:00 with 1.04 mm rain and another at 06:00 with 1.46 mm. However, the text says \"morning and evening,\" which might be misleading because the data points are at midnight and 6 AM, both in the early morning. There's no evening rain on Monday according to the data, so that's a potential error.\n\nMoving on, temperatures on the first day are stated as 26-29°C. The data for Monday shows temps around 26.68, 29.01, and 26.75, which fits within that range. So that part is correct.\n\nThe text mentions Wednesday having moderate rain. Looking at Wednesday's data (2025-02-05), the rain value is 2.01 mm, which is moderate. That seems accurate.\n\nThursday and Friday are said to have decreased precipitation with broken clouds and few clouds. The data for Thursday shows some rain (1.69 mm) but also periods of broken clouds. Friday has overcast and broken clouds with less rain. So that part aligns with the data.\n\nWinds are described as light, 1-4 m/s. Checking the wind speeds in the data: they range from 0.41 to 5.25 m/s, which fits within the stated range. So no error there.\n\nTemperatures are said to be consistent between 24-30°C. The data shows temps ranging from about 24.47 to 29.94, so that's accurate.\n\nNow, focusing on potential errors:\n\n1. The first day's rain is mentioned as morning and evening, but the data only shows early morning rains (midnight and 6 AM). There's no evening rain on Monday. So this is a Misleading error because it gives the impression of rain at both times when data doesn't support evening rain.\n\n2. The text says Thursday and Friday have decreased precipitation, which is true as the rain amounts are lower than Wednesday's moderate rain. However, the data shows that Thursday still has some rain (1.69 mm), so it's not entirely without rain. This might be a bit misleading but perhaps not a clear error.\n\n3. The text mentions \"few clouds\" on Friday, but looking at the data for Friday (2025-02-07 00:00:00), there are few clouds (23%), which is correct. So no issue here.\n\n4. The wind speeds mentioned cover the range in the data, so that's accurate.\n\nI think the main error is the mention of evening rain on Monday when the data doesn't support it.

No error here.\n\nThen: \"Light rain is expected on several days, including Wednesday and Thursday...\" The data shows light rain starting from Tuesday (2025-02-04) through Friday. So mentioning only Wednesday and Thursday misses Tuesday and Friday, making it misleading as important info is omitted.\n\nNext: \"...with the highest amount of rainfall predicted for Thursday at 5 mm.\" Looking at the data, on Thursday at 12:00, rain is exactly 5 mm, which matches.

So this seems accurate. No error here.\n\nSecond sentence: \"Temperatures will fluctuate, with daytime highs reaching up to 24 degrees Celsius and nighttime lows dipping as low as 7 degrees Celsius.\" Checking the data, the highest temp is around 24.78°C, which rounds to 25, but the text says 24. The lowest temp is 7.34°C, so saying 7 is correct. Wait, but in the data, there's a feels_like of 22.59 and actual temps like 23.74. So maybe the text is using feels_like? Or perhaps it's just approximated. Since the data allows for rounding, this might be okay.\n\nThird sentence: \"Winds will be generally light, ranging from 0.68 to 4.45 meters per second, with some gusts reaching up to 5.23 meters per second.\" The wind speeds in the data go up to 4.45 m/s, and the highest gust is 5.23 m/s.

So it's mostly clear, which matches the text. However, the text mentions 'partly cloudy', but in the data, the highest cloud cover is 3%, which isn't partly cloudy (usually partly cloudy is around 50-90%). So this might be misleading because it suggests more cloudiness than there actually is.\n\nSo the error here is that the text says \"some periods of partly cloudy skies\" when the data doesn't support that.

So it's not continuous throughout the day, making the text misleading.\n\nThe text also says Friday will be mostly cloudy with a peak of 6.95°C and scattered clouds in the evening. The data shows overcast clouds at 00:00, 06:00, and 12:00 on Friday (2025-02-07), but scattered clouds only at 18:00. So stating \"mostly cloudy\" might be misleading as it's overcast most of the day except in the evening.\n\nLastly, regarding winds, the text mentions light to moderate with occasional gusts later in the week. The data shows wind speeds mostly around 1-5 m/s, which is light to moderate, but there are higher gusts on Wednesday (6.52 m/s) and Thursday (7.6 m/s). However, this part seems accurate.\n\nSo, I identified two main errors: one about Wednesday's temperature being too high, and another about the rain duration on Thursday.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, the text mentions that Monday starts with light rain early in the day. Looking at the data for Monday (2025-02-03), there are two instances of light rain: one at 00:00 and another at 18:00. The first is at midnight, which is technically early morning, so that's correct. However, the second instance is at 6 PM, which isn't early in the day. So the text might be misleading by implying only an early rain when there's also one later.\n\nNext, on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning, the text says light rain is expected. Checking the data, Tuesday (2025-02-04) has light rain at 00:00 and 18:00. The 00:00 time is actually midnight, which is technically early Wednesday morning. So the text correctly mentions Tuesday evening but also includes Wednesday morning's rain as part of Tuesday, which might be a bit confusing.\n\nLooking at Thursday (2025-02-06), the text states there's light rain in the morning. The data shows rain at 06:00 on Thursday, so that's accurate. No issue here.\n\nNow, checking the temperature ranges. For Monday, the text says temperatures range from 26.45°C to 32.7°C. From the data, the lowest temp is around 26.45°C (at 18:00) and the highest is 32.7°C (at 06:00). That's correct.\n\nFor Tuesday and Wednesday, the peak temperature mentioned is around 30.47°C, which occurs on Tuesday at 06:00. The text says temperatures peak around that, but looking at other times, like Wednesday at 06:00, it's 30.43°C, which is close. So that seems accurate.\n\nOn Thursday and Friday, the text mentions temps from 24.6°C to 29.58°C. Checking the data, the lowest on those days is 24.6°C (Thursday 18:00) and the highest is 29.58°C (Friday 06:00). That's correct.\n\nWind speeds are mentioned as mostly below 5 m/s. The data shows a max wind speed of 5.1 m/s on Thursday at 06:00, which is just over 5. So technically, it's slightly above, but the text says \"mostly\" below, so that might be acceptable or could be misleading.\n\nPutting this together, I found two potential issues. The first is about the light rain on Monday being only early in the day when there's also a later instance. This could be misleading as it doesn't mention both times. The second issue is about the wind speed exceeding 5 m/s on Thursday, which contradicts the statement that winds are mostly below 5 m/s.\n\nI need to classify these errors. The first seems like a contradiction because it omits the later rain, making the text inaccurate. The second is also contradictory as it states something that isn't entirely true based on the data.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me go through each part of the text step by step.\n\nFirst, the text mentions \"over the next five days.\" Looking at the data, it starts from Monday, February 3rd, and goes up to Friday, February 7th. That's actually six days, not five. So that's a mistake.\n\nNext, the text says there will be occasional clear skies. From the data, I see that on Wednesday during the day, it's clear, but other than that, most days are cloudy or overcast. So \"occasional\" might be correct, but let me check if it's misleading.\n\nThen, regarding precipitation: the text mentions light precipitation, but according to the data, rain starts only on Friday afternoon and evening with specific amounts (1.38 mm and 1.13 mm). The other days don't have rain mentioned except for Tuesday evening which is drizzle but not sure if that counts as precipitation here.\n\nLooking at Monday and Tuesday's temperatures: the text says 4°C to 11°C, which matches the data. So no issue there.\n\nOn Wednesday, the text describes fog and mist in the early hours leading to sunny conditions. The data shows clear skies during the day but mentions fog and mist only in the morning. However, the text doesn't mention that it's only in the early hours, making it a bit misleading because it implies the whole day is sunny.\n\nThursday starts clear but transitions to clouds by evening. The data supports this with clear skies in the morning and broken clouds later. So that part seems accurate.\n\nFriday's description includes light rain in the afternoon and evening, which aligns with the data showing rain on Friday. However, the text doesn't specify the exact times or amounts, so it might be too vague but not necessarily wrong.\n\nThe temperature drop to 2°C on Friday is correct as per the data, which shows a low of around 2.08°C.\n\nWind speeds are mentioned to increase slightly on Tuesday evening and Friday. The data shows wind speed increases from 3.45 m/s to 4.63 m/s on Tuesday evening and up to 8.23 m/s on Friday morning, so that's accurate.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n1. The text says \"next five days,\" but the data covers six days (Monday to Saturday? Wait, no, from Monday 3rd to Friday 7th is five days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri). Wait, let me recount. From Feb 3 (Mon) to Feb 7 (Fri) is five days. So maybe that's correct. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, the data list has entries from '2025-02-03' to '2025-02-07', which is five days: 3rd (Mon), 4th (Tue), 5th (Wed), 6th (Thu), 7th (Fri). So the text correctly mentions five days. So that part was a mistake on my initial thought.\n\nNext, \"occasional clear skies\" – Wednesday has clear sky during the day, but other times are cloudy or foggy. So maybe it's accurate as occasional.\n\nLight precipitation is mentioned in the text, but according to data, rain occurs only on Friday afternoon and evening with specific amounts (1.38 mm and 1.13 mm). The text doesn't specify when, so it might be misleading because it implies more frequent light precipitation than actually present.\n\nThe part about Wednesday having fog and mist leading to sunny conditions is accurate in the data, but the text says \"giving way to sunny conditions during the day,\" which is correct as the sky is clear at 12:00. However, the text doesn't specify that it's only during certain times, so maybe it's a bit misleading.\n\nWait, no, the text does say \"in the early hours giving way to sunny conditions during the day,\" which matches the data (fog in the morning, clear by noon). So that part is correct.\n\nSo perhaps the main error is the mention of light precipitation being too vague or not accurately reflecting when it occurs. Alternatively, maybe there's no error because Friday does have rain.\n\nWait, let me check again. The text says \"light precipitation,\" and according to data, on Tuesday evening at 18:00, there's drizzle (id 300), which is light intensity. So the text might be correct in mentioning light precipitation as it occurs on both Tuesday evening and Friday.\n\nHmm, perhaps I was too hasty. Maybe the only error is that the text says \"over the next five days,\" but according to the data, it's actually six time points from 00:00 Monday to 18:00 Friday, which covers five full days (Monday to Friday). So maybe no error there.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me look again at the text and data.\n\nThe text says \"over the next five days,\" but in the data, it's from Monday to Friday, inclusive, which is five days: Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri. So that part is correct.\n\nSo maybe there are no errors? But I need to check each statement carefully.\n\nWait, the text mentions \"light precipitation\" without specifying when, but according to data, precipitation occurs on Tuesday evening (drizzle) and Friday afternoon/evening (light rain). So perhaps the text's mention of light precipitation is accurate as it does occur on some days. Therefore, maybe there are no errors.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the text says \"occasional clear skies,\" but in reality, only Wednesday has clear skies during the day, while other times are cloudy or foggy. So maybe that's misleading because it implies more clear periods than actually present.\n\nWait, the data shows on Wednesday at 12:00 and 18:00, it's clear sky. On Thursday morning, it's clear but becomes cloudy by evening. So perhaps \"occasional\" is accurate as there are a couple of clear periods.\n\nI'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for specific discrepancies.\n\nLooking again:\n\n- The text says the weather will be predominantly cloudy with occasional clear skies and light precipitation. According to data, most days are overcast except Wednesday which has clear skies during the day. So \"occasional\" is correct.\n\n- Light precipitation occurs on Tuesday evening (drizzle) and Friday afternoon/evening (light rain). The text mentions it without specifics, so maybe that's acceptable.\n\nWait, but in the data, on Tuesday at 18:00, there's light drizzle, which is a form of precipitation. So the text correctly mentions light precipitation.\n\nSo perhaps there are no errors? But I need to make sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the temperature range mentioned for Monday and Tuesday (4°C to 11°C) is accurate as per data.\n\nWait, on Monday, the temps go from around 4°C up to 7.43°C at noon, then back down. On Tuesday, it goes up to 11.13°C at noon. So the text's range of 4°C to 11°C is correct.\n\nThe wind speeds: increasing slightly by Tuesday evening. Data shows wind speed on Monday at 3.45 m/s and Tuesday evening at 4.63 m/s, so that's an increase.\n\nWednesday's description in the text matches data: fog and mist early, then clear.\n\nThursday starts clear but becomes cloudy, which is correct per data.\n\nFriday has overcast skies with light rain, matching data.\n\nSo perhaps there are no errors? But I need to check again.\n\nWait, the text says \"light precipitation,\" but according to data, on Tuesday evening at 18:00, it's drizzle (id 300), and on Friday afternoon and evening, it's light rain. So the text correctly mentions light precipitation without specifying exact days, which is acceptable.\n\nTherefore, I think there are no errors in the text based on the provided data.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me go through each sentence step by step.\n\nFirst, the text says Santa Maria will have predominantly overcast skies for five days with occasional light to moderate rain. Looking at the data, from Monday to Friday, most days do show overcast or similar cloud cover, so that seems accurate.\n\nNext, it mentions intermittent rainfall on Monday and Tuesday, which matches the data as both days have 'light rain' entries. The heaviest rain is noted on Tuesday evening with 5.2 mm. Checking the data for Tuesday at 18:00, yes, the rain value is exactly 5.2 mm. So that part seems correct.\n\nNow, the temperature range is stated as 24.47°C to 29.5°C. The lowest temp in the data is 24.47°C on Thursday at 00:00, and the highest is 29.5°C on Tuesday at 06:00. That aligns with the text, so no issue there.\n\nThe \"feels-like\" temperature peaks at 36.5°C on Tuesday morning. The data shows that on Tuesday at 06:00, feels_like is indeed 36.5°C. So that's accurate too.\n\nWind speeds are described as mostly between 1 and 5 m/s, varying in direction. Reviewing the wind speed values across all entries, they range from about 0.41 to 5.25 m/s, which fits within the 1-5 range when rounded. So that seems correct.\n\nLastly, by Friday, cloud cover decreases with a mix of broken and few clouds. The data for Friday shows 23% clouds at 00:00, then 100% overcast later, but also some entries with 78% and 100%. Wait, on Friday at 12:00, it's 78% broken clouds, which is less than overcast (100%). So the text says cloud cover decreases slightly, which is true as there are periods of fewer clouds.\n\nI don't see any contradictions or errors in the text based on the data provided.

Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the text carefully:\n\n\"The city of Sampiro in the Philippines will experience predominantly cloudy conditions over the next five days, with intermittent periods of light rain. Monday will see broken and scattered clouds with temperatures peaking at 31.3°C and light winds. Rain is expected to begin on Tuesday afternoon, continuing through the week, with the heaviest rainfall of 5 mm forecasted on Thursday afternoon. Winds will gradually strengthen, reaching speeds of up to 12.76 m/s by Friday. Temperatures will remain relatively stable, ranging from 24.49°C to 31.3°C, with a slight cooling trend toward the end of the week.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare each part of this text against the data provided.\n\n1. **City and Country**: The text correctly states \"Sampiro\" in the Philippines, which matches the data. No error here.\n\n2. **Cloudy Conditions**: The data shows varying cloud coverage from 26% to 100%, so \"predominantly cloudy\" seems accurate as most days have high cloud percentages. Okay.\n\n3. **Intermittent Light Rain**: Checking the data, rain starts on Tuesday at 12:00 with 0.55 mm and continues through the week. The text mentions intermittent periods, which aligns with the data showing rain on specific times but not all. So this is correct.\n\n4. **Monday's Weather**: The text says broken and scattered clouds. Looking at Monday's data:\n- 00:00: 57% (broken)\n- 06:00: 88% (overcast)\n- 12:00: 26% (scattered)\nSo, it does have both broken and scattered clouds. Temperature peaks at 31.3°C on Monday at 06:00, which matches the data. Winds are light, with speeds around 2.57 to 4.32 m/s, so \"light winds\" is accurate.\n\n5. **Rain Start on Tuesday Afternoon**: The data shows rain starting on Tuesday at 12:00 (0.55 mm), but in the text, it says \"Tuesday afternoon.\" Wait, in the data, Tuesday's entries are:\n- 00:00: broken clouds\n- 06:00: overcast\n- 12:00: light rain (0.55 mm)\nSo, the first rain is on Tuesday at noon, which is afternoon. That seems correct.\n\n6. **Heaviest Rainfall of 5 mm on Thursday Afternoon**: Looking through the data for Thursdays:\n- 2025-02-06 12:00:00 has 5 mm of rain.\nSo that's accurate. The text correctly states this.\n\n7. **Winds Strengthening to 12.76 m/s by Friday**: Checking wind speeds, on Friday at 12:00, the speed is 9.1 m/s with a gust of 12.76 m/s. However, the data shows that the maximum wind speed (gust) is 12.76 m/s on Friday at noon. The text says \"winds will reach up to 12.76 m/s,\" which refers to the gust, not the sustained speed. But in the data, 'speed' is the sustained wind speed, and 'gust' is a separate field. So if the text mentions wind speeds reaching 12.76, it might be confusing because that's the gust, not the average speed. However, sometimes weather reports include gusts as part of wind descriptions. I'm not sure if this is an error or acceptable.\n\n8. **Temperature Range**: The text states temperatures range from 24.49°C to 31.3°C. Checking the data:\n- The lowest temp is 24.49°C on Wednesday at 18:00.\n- The highest is 31.3°C on Monday at 06:00.\nSo this is accurate.\n\n9. **Slight Cooling Trend**: Towards the end of the week, temperatures do decrease slightly from earlier days, so that's correct.\n\nNow, looking for errors:\n\n- I don't see any contradictions or uncheckable facts. All statements seem to align with the data provided. The only possible point was about wind speed mentioning 12.76 m/s as a gust, but since it's part of the data and sometimes included in wind reports, it might not be an error.\n\nTherefore, there are no clear errors that fit into the annotation categories provided.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me go through each sentence step by step.\n\nFirst, the text says the weather will remain predominantly clear with no significant cloud cover. Looking at the data, most days have 0 clouds, except one day with 1 and another with 3. So \"no significant\" might be a bit misleading because there are some clouds, but it's not major. I'm not sure if this is worth flagging as an error.\n\nNext, daytime temperatures range from 21°C to 24°C. Checking the data, the highest temp is around 24.78°C and the lowest during the day is about 7.34°C, but wait, that's actually the feels_like temperature. The actual temp during the day goes down to 7.69°C on Monday at noon. So the text says nighttime temps drop to as low as 7°C, which matches the data. But the daytime range in the text is 21-24, but looking at the data, there's a point where temp is 15.06°C on Monday morning and 16.83°C on Tuesday morning. Wait, those are early morning temps, not exactly daytime highs. The highest day temps are around 23-24°C, so maybe the text is accurate for daytime.\n\nThen, nighttime temps drop to as low as 7°C to 16°C. The data shows feels_like can be as low as 7.34°C and actual temp down to 7.69°C. So that part seems correct.\n\nWinds are light with gusts up to 5.23 m/s on Friday. Checking the wind speeds, yes, on Friday at 00:00, the speed is 4.45 m/s, but there's a gust of 5.23 m/s mentioned. So that's accurate.\n\nPressure fluctuates between 1012 and 1020 hPa. The data shows pressure ranging from 1012 to 1020, so that's correct.\n\nThe text mentions calm and dry weather. All the weather descriptions are 'clear sky', so it is dry. But 'calm' might be subjective since winds can be up to 5 m/s, but generally, they're light. Not sure if that's an error.\n\nWait, looking back at the first part about cloud cover. The text says \"no significant cloud cover,\" but on some days, clouds are at 1 or 3, which is not zero. So maybe it's a bit misleading because there are some clouds, even if not significant. But I'm not certain if this is an error since it's minor.\n\nI think the only clear error is the statement about cloud cover being \"no significant,\" when in reality, there are days with 1 or 3 clouds.
