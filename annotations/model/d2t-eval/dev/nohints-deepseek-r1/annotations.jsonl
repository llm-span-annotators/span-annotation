This is misleading as it conflates storage and RAM, potentially confusing readers about the total memory.\n\nThe battery life in the text states up to 171h standby on GSM and 3.5h talk time on HSDPA. The data actually specifies that the standby is up to 171h (3G), not GSM. So this is a contradiction because it misattributes the network type for standby time.\n\nLastly, the text says the device lacks A-GPS, but according to the data, it does have A-GPS only under positioning.

No error here.\n\n2. \"The match saw several goals scored throughout, including two from Vila Nova in the first half by Alesson and Luciano Naninho.\"\n- Checking the events, both Alesson (18') and Luciano Naninho (34') scored in the first half. That's accurate.\n\n3. \"Ituano's José Aldo and Leozinho also found the back of the net, with Salatiel and Vinícius Paiva adding to their team's tally in the second half.\"\n- José Aldo scored at 6', which is the first half, not the second. So this is a mistake because it incorrectly states he scored in the second half.\n\n4. \"The game was marked by a number of substitutions and yellow cards issued to players on both teams, including several in stoppage time.\"\n- The data shows multiple substitutions (e.g., 41',46',50') and many yellow cards, especially in stoppage time (e.g., 90'+8\", 90'+10\"). This is correct.\n\n5. \"In the end, Ituano's four goals were enough to secure the win, despite Vila Nova's strong effort.\"\n- The score was indeed 4-3 for Ituano, so this is accurate.\n\nNow, focusing on the third sentence: It incorrectly places José Aldo's goal in the second half. According to the data, his goal was at 6', which is first half. So this is a contradictory error because it directly contradicts the data.\n\nI should classify this as a Contradictory error (type 0). The text mentions \"second half\" while the data shows it happened in the first half.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me break down how I approached this.\n\nFirst, I read through the data provided. It includes details about a football match between Auckland City and Napier City Rovers. The data shows that Auckland won 1-0 with a goal in the 90th minute by S. Ukich. There were several substitutions from both teams, with Napier making five and Auckland four.\n\nNext, I looked at the generated text. It correctly states the score, the venue, date, and the goal details. However, I noticed something about the substitutions. The text says Napier made five changes and Auckland four, which matches the data. But then it mentions that both teams made a total of nine substitutions. Wait, in reality, each substitution involves one team, so adding them gives nine, but that's correct because each substitution is counted per team.\n\nWait, no, actually, each substitution is a single event per team. So Napier had five subs and Auckland four, totaling nine events, which is accurate. But the text says \"nine substitutions,\" which might be misleading because it could imply nine players were substituted in total, but each sub event only affects one player per team. However, the way it's worded isn't incorrect; it's just a matter of clarity.\n\nI considered whether this was a 'Misleading' error because it might confuse readers about the number of substitutions. But upon reflection, since each substitution is counted per team, stating nine in total is technically correct, even if it could be clearer. So I decided not to classify it as an error but noted it as something to consider.\n\nI then checked for other potential errors: contradictory facts, unverifiable claims, incoherence, etc. The text accurately reflects the data without any contradictions or unclear phrasing.

Checking the data, the goals are home:1 and away:2, which matches, so that's accurate.\n\nThe text states that Rhode Island took the lead with an own goal by N. Dossantos at 43'. The data shows this event correctly, so no problem here.\n\nThen, it says after halftime, Rhode Island extended their lead with a Normal Goal from N. Fuson assisted by C. Holstad in the 53rd minute.

Checking the data, the score is indeed 2-2 for both home and away goals, so that's correct.\n\nNext, it talks about G. Córdoba scoring an own goal in the 14th minute. The data shows an event at 14' by Isidro Metapán as a Goal with detail 'Own Goal', so that matches.\n\nThen, J. Williams scores for Once Municipal in the 31st minute. The data has an event at 31' by Once Municipal as a Normal Goal, which aligns correctly.\n\nAt halftime, the score is tied 1-1. According to the data's halftime scores, home (Isidro) had 1 and away (Once) also 1, so that's accurate.\n\nIn the second half, Y. Delgadillo scores a penalty in the 49th minute for Isidro Metapán. The data shows this event at 49' as a Goal with detail 'Penalty', correct again.\n\nThen, J. Williams equalizes again in the 90+2 minute. Checking the events, there's a goal by Once Municipal at \"90' +2\" by J. Williams, so that's accurate too.\n\nThe text mentions both teams made multiple substitutions, totaling 9 changes. Looking at the data's events, I count substitutions from each team: Isidro Metapán has substitutions at 56',70'(two),85'; Once Municipal at 57'(two),65',70'. That totals to 5 substitutions for Isidro and 4 for Once, making it 9 in total. So that part is correct.\n\nFinally, the match ended after 90 minutes plus 5 minutes of extra time. The data's status shows 'elapsed':90 and 'extra':5, so that's accurate as well.\n\nWait a minute, I need to make sure there are no contradictions or misleading statements.

Steinwascher at 40 minutes. Checking the data, I see that event indeed happened at \"40'\", so that's correct.\n\nNext, the text states that Birkenhead United scored two goals: one at 71 minutes and another in 90+6, which was a penalty. The data confirms both these events, with M. Patterson scoring at those times, including the penalty. So that part seems accurate.\n\nThe text also notes several substitutions by both teams. The data lists multiple substitutions for each team, so this is correct as well.\n\nNow, looking for any errors. I notice that in the text, it says \"the latter being a penalty.\" In the data, M. Patterson's goal at 90+6 is indeed marked as a 'Penalty' under detail. However, the text doesn't specify who scored the penalty. It just mentions \"him,\" referring to M. Patterson. Wait, in the data, both goals by M. Patterson are listed: one normal and one penalty. So the text correctly attributes both goals to him.\n\nWait, but looking again, the first goal at 71' is a 'Normal Goal', and the second at 90+6 is a 'Penalty'. The text says \"another from him as well in the 90+6 minute, the latter being a penalty.\" That's correct because it clarifies that the second goal was a penalty.

This seems like a contradictory error because it directly conflicts with the information provided.\n\nI don't see any other discrepancies in the text regarding the score or the players involved in goals for Alianza.

Let me break down how I approached this.\n\nFirst, I read through the data provided. It includes details about a football match between Diriangén and Jalapa. The score was 6-0 in favor of Diriangén. The events list shows multiple goals by O. Orozco at times 25' and 47', J. Arteaga at 58', R. Rodríguez at 59', M. Hernández at 63', and R. Carballo at 77'. So, that's six goals in total.\n\nNext, I looked at the generated text. It states that O. Orozco and J. Arteaga each contributed two goals. But according to the data, O. Orozco scored twice (25' and 47'), which is correct. However, J. Arteaga only scored once at 58'. The other goals were by R. Rodríguez, M. Hernández, and R. Carballo, each scoring once. So, the text incorrectly attributes two goals to J. Arteaga when he only scored one.\n\nI considered the error categories. This seems like a \"Contradictory\" error because the text directly contradicts the data provided. The data shows that J. Arteaga scored once, but the text says twice. Therefore, it's a clear contradiction.\n\nI made sure there were no other errors. The rest of the text aligns with the data: the score, venue, date, and referee are all correct. There's no mention of substitutions being a hindrance in the data, but that part is more about interpretation rather than a fact, so it doesn't fall into any error category.\n\nFinally, I structured the JSON response as per the user's instructions, ensuring each field was correctly filled with the reason, text span, and annotation type.", "annotator_group": 0}

The output should be a JSON object with annotations. Each annotation includes a reason, the problematic text span, and an annotation type based on predefined categories.\n\nLooking at the data provided, it's about a football match between Isidro Metapán and Once Municipal. The text to annotate describes the game, including goals and substitutions. My job is to compare this text against the data to spot any errors.\n\nFirst, I'll go through each sentence of the generated text and cross-reference it with the data.\n\nThe first part mentions a 2-2 draw on November 17th, 2024. Checking the data, under 'datetime', it's indeed \"2024-11-17 02:15:00\", so that seems correct.\n\nNext, Isidro Metapán scored first with an own goal by G. Córdoba at 14'. The data shows an event at 14' where G. Córdoba from Isidro Metapán scored an own goal. That's accurate.\n\nThen, J. Williams scored for Once Municipal at 31', which matches the data—there's a goal event at 31' by J. Williams for the away team.\n\nAfter that, Y. Delgadillo scored on a penalty at 49'. The data confirms this with an event at 49' where he scored a penalty. So far, no issues here.\n\nThe text then states that Isidro Metapán took a 2-1 lead. Wait, let me check the score progression. At halftime, the score was 1-1 (home:1, away:1). After 49', home scores again, making it 2-1. But later in the data, at 90'+2, J. Williams scored another goal for Once Municipal, which would make the final score 2-2. So the text correctly mentions the lead but doesn't note that Once Municipal equalized later.\n\nHowever, the text says \"The match saw several substitutions from both teams throughout the game.\" Looking at the data's events, there are multiple substitutions listed from both teams, so this part is accurate.\n\nWait a minute, I think I missed something. The own goal by G. Córdoba was for Isidro Metapán, but in football, an own goal means the player scored against their own team. So if G. Córdoba plays for Isidro Metapán and scored an own goal, that would mean Once Municipal actually scored at 14'. The text says Isidro Metapán scored first with that own goal, which is incorrect because it should be Once Municipal scoring.\n\nSo the error here is contradictory. The text claims Isidro Metapán scored first, but according to the data, it was an own goal, meaning the goal went to Once Municipal. Therefore, this part of the text contradicts the data.\n\nI need to classify this error. Since it's a fact that directly opposes the data, it falls under \"Contradictory,\" which is category 0.\n\nSo the annotation should include the reason explaining the contradiction, the exact text span, and the type as 0.", "annotator_group": 0}

The text states: \"Coastal Spirit faced Birkenhead United in a National League match. Coastal Spirit scored first in the 56th minute with a goal from A. Steinwascher, assisted by K. Hayashi.

Looking at the data, the goal was indeed at \"40'\" by A. Steinwascher without an assist. Wait, that's a contradiction because the text says 56th minute with an assist from K. Hayashi, but the data shows it happened earlier and without an assist.\n\nMoving on to Birkenhead United's goals: The text states they scored in the 71st and 77th minutes through M. Patterson and D. Bunch. Checking the data, M. Patterson scored at 71' with a normal goal and then again at \"90' +6\" with a penalty. So the second goal by Birkenhead was actually in extra time, not at 77'. Also, D. Bunch's substitution is noted at 77', but he didn't score; it was M. Patterson who scored twice.\n\nThe final sentence correctly states the result as 2-1 in favor of Birkenhead United, which aligns with the data.\n\nSo, I identified two errors:\n\n1. The first goal's time and assist are incorrect.\n2. The second goal is misattributed to D. Bunch instead of M. Patterson and incorrectly timed at 77' instead of extra time.\n\nThese fall under \"Contradictory\" as they directly oppose the data provided.", "annotator_group": 0}

Checking the data, on Monday at 06:00, it's clear sky (3%), Tuesday morning has few clouds (13%), Wednesday has overcast (100% clouds), and so on. So that seems accurate.\n\nNext, temperatures are mentioned to fluctuate around mid-teens, but looking at the data, the highest feels_like is 16.47°C, which is indeed in the mid-teens. The lowest feels_like is 3.9°C on Tuesday morning. That part checks out.\n\nWind speeds are described as light to moderate, around 1 m/s with occasional gusts higher. From the data, wind speeds vary but generally stay under 4 m/s except for Thursday when they go up to about 5.64 m/s.

The data shows rain on Thursday at 00:00 and 06:00, but the wind speeds mentioned are within the range, so that seems correct.\n\nNow, looking for potential errors:\n\n1. The text says temperatures peak around 4.5-6.95°C during midweek afternoons under overcast conditions. However, in the data, on Wednesday at 12:00, feels_like is 12.76°C and temp is 14.57°C.

The text says \"no further precipitation after Thursday night into early next week.\" The data doesn't show any rain beyond Thursday, so that part seems correct.\n\nAnother point: The text mentions pressure decreasing from 1021 hPa on Monday to its lowest on Wednesday night (1006 hPa) before recovering. That's accurate based on the data.\n\nWait, but looking back at the temperature part, the feels_like on Wednesday is higher than what the text indicates. So that might be a contradictory point because the text says temperatures peak around 4.5-6.95°C, but the data shows higher values.\n\nSo I think there's an error here where the text under-reports the highest temperatures.

Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the generated text carefully and compare it with the data to spot any discrepancies or issues.\n\nThe text mentions that cloud coverage will be high with occasional scattered and broken clouds throughout each day into Friday evening. Looking at the data, from February 3rd to 7th, most days have high cloud coverage, especially reaching 100% on some days. However, I notice that on Thursday at 6 AM (2025-02-06 06:00:00), the clouds are only 11%, which is 'few clouds'. The text doesn't mention this clearer sky period, so it's misleading by not including this break in cloud coverage.\n\nNext, the text states temperatures range from a low of 24.8°C on Wednesday at noon up to around 26°C. Checking the data, the lowest temp is indeed 24.73°C on Friday at midnight, but the high is actually 31.3°C on Monday at 6 AM. The text doesn't mention this higher temperature, making it misleading as it omits the warmer period.\n\nThe feels-like temperatures are said to mirror actual temps due to humidity and clouds, suggesting warm conditions. However, the data shows feels-like temps are often lower than actual, especially in the evenings, which contradicts the statement about warmth.\n\nLight rain is mentioned with amounts up to 5mm on Thursday afternoon. The data does show 5mm at 2025-02-06 12:00:00, but there's also a higher amount of 5.55mm on Friday at midnight (2025-02-07 00:00:00). The text doesn't include this, so it's misleading by not noting the heavier rain.\n\nWind speeds are stated to range up to 12.76m/s with gusts up to 12.43m/s. However, the data shows a higher gust of 12.76m/s on Wednesday at noon (2025-02-05 12:00:00), which isn't mentioned, making the text incomplete and thus misleading.\n\nLastly, pressure levels are said to be stable between 1009-1012hPa.

Let me start by carefully reading both the text and the data.\n\nFirst, the text mentions that wind speeds will vary between calm conditions at night (0-1.85 m/s) up to gusts of about 7.5 m/s during Thursday and Friday evenings. Looking at the data, I see that on those days, the maximum wind speed is around 5.23 m/s, not 7.5. So this seems like an overestimation.\n\nNext, the text states that temperatures range from a low of approximately 7°C during midday hours down to around 12°C in the early morning and evening. However, checking the data, the lowest temperature recorded is actually lower than 7°C on some days, such as 9.14°C and 7.34°C. So this is contradictory because it claims a lower temp than what's present.\n\nThe text also says that feels-like temperatures are consistent with actual air temps due to clear skies. But in the data, I notice discrepancies between feels_like and temp, like on Feb 3 at 00:00, feels_like is 22.59 vs temp of 23.74. These aren't exactly the same, so the text's claim isn't accurate.\n\nLastly, the text mentions that cloud cover readings are zero all day, but on February 5th and 6th, there are some cloud covers (3 and 0 respectively). Wait, actually, most days have 0 clouds except one. Maybe this is a minor point, but I think it's more accurate to say mostly clear skies rather than no precipitation or snow throughout each day.\n\nSo, I'll classify these errors as Contradictory for the temp range, Misleading for wind speeds, and Incoherent for feels-like temps. The cloud cover might not be an error since only one day has clouds.", "annotator_group": 0}

Looking at the data, the lowest temperature is indeed around -16°C, but the highest is about -1.91°C. So the upper range in the text says 0°C, which isn't supported by the data. That's a problem because it's contradictory.\n\nNext, the text states that on Wednesday, there may be additional light snowfall. Checking the data for Wednesday, I see that at 12:00, there's light snow, but no other mentions of snow that day. So saying \"additional\" might imply more instances than actually occurred, which could be misleading.\n\nThen, the wind speeds are described as moderate, around 1-3 m/s with gusts up to 4 m/s. The data shows some higher gusts, like 4.12 m/s on Wednesday and 3.23 m/s on Thursday. While mostly within the range, the text doesn't mention these slightly higher gusts, which might be considered misleading as it leaves out some details.\n\nLastly, the text says that by Friday, there will be clear skies during the day turning to broken clouds in the evening. The data for Friday shows clear skies at 12:00 and broken clouds at 18:00, so this part is accurate.

My task is to check each part of the summary against the data to spot any discrepancies or issues.\n\nStarting with the temperature: The text mentions a low of around 2°C. Checking the data, I see that the minimum temp is 4.21°C on Friday at 18:00. So, the text's statement about 2°C is incorrect; it contradicts the data. That falls under the 'Contradictory' category.\n\nNext, the feels-like temperatures are mentioned to fluctuate, which aligns with the data showing varying values each day. No issue there.\n\nWind speeds are described as moderate with gusts up to 7.6 m/s. The data indeed shows a wind gust of 7.6 on Thursday at 18:00, so that's accurate.\n\nRain is forecasted for Thursday, which matches the data indicating light rain on that day.

So that seems accurate. No error here.\n\nNext, it says there will be light rain showers intermittently, with precipitation between 0.89 mm and 3.63 mm. Checking the data, I see rain amounts like 1.46, 0.89, 1.76, 3.63, etc. So that's correct too.\n\nThe temperature range is stated as 24.6°C to 32.7°C. From the data, the lowest temp is 24.6 and the highest is 32.7. That matches exactly, so no issue there.\n\nWind speeds are mentioned from 0.4 m/s to 5.1 m/s. The data shows wind speeds varying, including a high of 5.1 m/s on Thursday at 06:00. So that's accurate as well.\n\nPressure levels are said to be around 1008-1011 hPa. Looking through the main pressure values in the data, they indeed fall within this range. No problem here.\n\nNow, the text states that winds will blow from varying directions with gusts up to 4.94 m/s. The data does show varying wind directions and a gust of 4.94 m/s on Thursday at 06:00. So that part is correct too.\n\nWait, but I notice that the text doesn't mention any days without rain or overcast conditions. However, looking back, every day in the data has either 'Clouds' or 'Rain' as the main weather, so it's accurate to say mostly overcast with intermittent rain.

Let me start by understanding both the data and the text.\n\nFirst, looking at the data, it's a 5-day forecast for Plouay, France. Each day has multiple time slots with detailed weather information. The units are in Celsius, meters per second, etc., which matches the text's units.\n\nThe text mentions temperatures ranging from around 2 to 11°C. Checking the data, on Friday at 12:00, the temp is 3.82°C, and earlier it was lower, like 4°C on Monday. The highest temp is on Tuesday at 11.13°C. So that range seems accurate.\n\nNext, the text says the first two days have consistent cloud cover and light winds. From the data, Monday and Tuesday (first two days) indeed have high cloud coverage, mostly overcast. Wind speeds are around 2-4 m/s, which is light. That checks out.\n\nWednesday's forecast in the data shows clear skies during the day with 0 clouds, but the text says a brief period of clear skies before cloudy conditions on Thursday. Wait, looking at Wednesday's data, it starts with fog and mist in the morning, then clears up by noon. So the text is correct about clear skies on Wednesday.\n\nThursday's data shows some cloudiness, especially by evening with overcast clouds. The text mentions returning to cloudy conditions on Thursday, which aligns with the data.\n\nFriday's chance of light rain is supported by the data, which shows rain starting from 12:00 with 1.38 mm. So that part is accurate.\n\nWind speeds in the text are stated as varying from 2 to 8 m/s. Checking the data, the highest wind speed is 8.23 m/s on Friday at 00:00. The lowest is around 1 m/s on Wednesday morning. So the range seems correct.\n\nNow, looking for errors. The text says \"temperatures ranging from around 2 to 11 degrees Celsius.\" However, in the data, the minimum temp is actually lower than 2°C. On Friday at 06:00, it's 3.9°C, but wait, no—looking again, on Friday at 12:00, it's 3.82°C, and earlier that day it was 4°C. Wait, maybe I missed something.\n\nWait, checking the data again for each day:\n\n- Monday: Temps around 4°C.\n- Tuesday: Up to 11.13°C.\n- Wednesday: Around 7.8°C in the evening.\n- Thursday: Around 5.38°C at the start, up to 7.06°C during the day.\n- Friday: Starts at 4°C, goes down to 3.9°C and lower.\n\nWait, on Friday at 12:00, it's 3.82°C, but earlier that day at 06:00, it's 3.9°C. So the lowest temp is around 2.08°C on Friday evening? Wait no, looking again:\n\nIn the data for Friday at 18:00, the temp is 2.08°C. So the minimum temperature in the data is actually lower than what the text states. The text says \"around 2,\" but according to the data, it goes down to about 2°C on Friday evening.\n\nWait, no—the text says \"ranging from around 2 to 11 degrees.\" But looking at the data, the lowest temp is 2.08°C on Friday at 18:00. So that's accurate. Wait, but earlier in the week, like Monday and Tuesday, temps are higher. So maybe the text is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me check each day's minimum and maximum:\n\n- Monday: Temps around 4°C.\n- Tuesday: Up to 11.13°C.\n- Wednesday: Around 7.8°C in the evening.\n- Thursday: Starts at 5.38°C, up to 7.06°C during the day.\n- Friday: From 4°C down to 2.08°C.\n\nSo the lowest temp is 2.08°C on Friday evening, and the highest is 11.13°C on Tuesday. So the text's range of 2-11°C is correct.\n\nWait, but in the data, on Wednesday at 06:00, it's 4.65°C, which is lower than Monday's. But the overall minimum is still around 2°C on Friday. So maybe the text is accurate.\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to look for other errors. The text mentions \"light rain\" on Friday with up to 1.38 mm. Checking the data, yes, at 12:00 on Friday, it's 1.38 mm of rain. That seems correct.\n\nWait, but in the data, there's also rain on Friday at 18:00 with 1.13 mm. So total precipitation might be more than 1.38 mm? Or is that per hour? The units are mm/h (6h), so maybe it's cumulative over 6 hours. But the text says \"up to 1.38 mm,\" which matches the data at 12:00.\n\nAnother point: the text mentions wind speeds varying from 2 to 8 m/s. In the data, on Friday at 00:00, wind speed is 8.23 m/s, so that's correct. The lowest wind speed is around 1 m/s on Wednesday morning. So the range in the text is accurate.\n\nWait, but the text says \"from approximately 2 to 8 meters per second.\" However, the data shows a lower value of about 1 m/s. So maybe the text is incorrect there because it doesn't mention the lower wind speed.\n\nBut wait, looking at the data:\n\n- Wednesday at 00:00: wind speed 1.03 m/s.\n- Wednesday at 06:00: same.\n- Other times have higher speeds.\n\nSo the minimum wind speed is around 1 m/s, but the text says \"from approximately 2 to 8.\" That's a discrepancy. So that could be an error of type 'Contradictory' because the data shows lower wind speeds than stated in the text.\n\nWait, no—the text says \"vary from approximately 2 to 8,\" but the data has lower. So it's contradictory because the text claims the minimum is 2 m/s, while data shows 1 m/s.\n\nSo that would be an error of type 0: Contradictory.\n\nAnother possible error: The text mentions \"the first two days will see consistent cloud cover.\" Looking at the data, Monday and Tuesday (first two days) have high cloud cover, so that's correct.\n\nWait, but on Tuesday at 12:00, clouds are 99%, which is still mostly cloudy. So no issue there.\n\nAnother point: The text says \"Wednesday brings a brief period of clear skies before returning to cloudy conditions on Thursday.\" In the data, Wednesday has clear skies at noon and evening, so that's correct. Thursday starts with clear skies in the morning but becomes overcast by evening. Wait, no—Thursday at 12:00 has broken clouds (75%), which is partly cloudy, not overcast. So maybe the text is a bit misleading because it says \"cloudy conditions on Thursday,\" but Thursday isn't entirely overcast until the evening.\n\nWait, in the data for Thursday:\n\n- 00:00: clear sky.\n- 06:00: clear sky.\n- 12:00: broken clouds (75%).\n- 18:00: overcast clouds.\n\nSo by Thursday evening, it's overcast. So the text says \"returning to cloudy conditions on Thursday,\" which is accurate because Thursday ends with overcast.\n\nAnother possible error: The text mentions \"mostly overcast skies\" overall, but Wednesday has clear skies for part of the day. However, the text does mention \"some periods of clearer skies,\" so that's accounted for.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something else. Let me check again.\n\nLooking back at the temperature range, the data shows a minimum of 2.08°C on Friday evening, which aligns with the text's \"around 2.\" So no error there.\n\nThe wind speed discrepancy is the main issue. The text says winds vary from 2 to 8 m/s, but data shows as low as 1.03 m/s. Therefore, that's a contradictory error because the text's lower bound doesn't match the data.\n\nSo I think that's the only error. Let me structure it according to the required JSON format.", "annotator_group": 0}
{"dataset": "d2t-openweather", "split": "gold-final", "example_idx": 4, "setup_id": "llama3-3", "annotations": [{"reason": "The temperature range contradicts the data.", "text": "ranging from 26 to 29 degrees Celsius", "type": 0, "start": 227}], "thinking_trace": "Alright, I need to identify errors in the provided text based on the given data and classify them using the specified categories. Let me start by carefully reading both the data and the generated text.\n\nFirst, looking at the data structure, it's a JSON object containing weather information for Santa Maria over several days. Each day has details like clouds, temperature, wind speed, etc. The text to be annotated is a summary of this data.\n\nI'll go through each sentence in the text and cross-reference with the data.\n\n1. \"Over the next five days, Santa Maria can expect a mix of rain and overcast clouds, with light to moderate rain showers occurring on multiple days.\"\n- Checking the data, I see that every day except maybe some parts have either rain or overcast clouds. So this seems accurate. No error here.\n\n2. \"The first day will see light rain in the morning and evening, with temperatures ranging from 26 to 29 degrees Celsius.\"\n- The data for '2025-02-03' shows rain at 00:00 and 06:00, but also overcast clouds at 12:00. So it's not just morning and evening; there's a midday part too. This might be misleading because it implies only morning and evening have rain, but actually, the data shows more instances or perhaps continuous rain? Wait, looking again, each 'dt_txt' is every six hours. So 00:00 (midnight), 06:00 (morning), 12:00 (noon), etc. On the first day, there's light rain at midnight and morning, but overcast clouds at noon. So the text says \"light rain in the morning and evening,\" but according to data, it's midnight and morning. Evening would be 18:00, which on the first day is still Monday (2025-02-03 18:00) shows light rain as well. Wait, no, looking at the list index 3 is '2025-02-03 18:00:00' with light rain. So actually, there's rain at midnight, morning, and evening. The text says \"morning and evening,\" which might be correct because it's mentioning multiple times but not all. However, the data shows that on the first day, there are three instances of light rain (00:00, 06:00, 18:00). So the text is accurate in stating morning and evening, as those are specific times.\n\n3. \"As the week progresses, Wednesday is expected to bring moderate rain, while Thursday and Friday will see a decrease in precipitation, with some periods of broken clouds and few clouds.\"\n- Checking Wednesday (2025-02-05), at 00:00 it's moderate rain, but other times are overcast or light rain. So the text correctly mentions moderate rain on Wednesday. For Thursday and Friday, looking at their data points, there is indeed less rain. On Thursday, only one instance of light rain in the morning (06:00) and some broken clouds later. Friday has mostly overcast or few clouds with no rain mentioned except maybe 18:00 which is overcast. So this part seems accurate.\n\n4. \"Throughout the period, winds will be generally light, blowing at speeds of around 1-4 meters per second from varying directions.\"\n- Looking at wind speeds in the data, they range approximately between 0.41 m/s up to about 5.25 m/s. So saying 1-4 m/s is mostly accurate but there are instances where it's slightly below or above. However, 'generally light' seems fair as most speeds are within that range.\n\n5. \"Temperatures are expected to remain relatively consistent, ranging from 24 to 30 degrees Celsius throughout the five-day period.\"\n- Checking the main.temp values across all days: The lowest is around 24.47°C and the highest is about 29.94°C. So the text says 24-30, which is accurate.\n\nWait, but looking again at the data for '2025-02-05 12:00:00', temp is 26.03, feels_like 26.03. On '2025-02-07 06:00:00', temp is 27.33, feels_like 29.63. So the actual temperatures don't reach 30°C; the highest is around 29.94. The text says up to 30, which is a slight overstatement but very close. However, since it's within a degree, maybe it's acceptable as an approximation.\n\nWait another point: In the data, on '2025-02-05 06:00:00', feels_like is 26.23°C, and temp is also 26.23. On '2025-02-07 06:00:00', feels_like is 29.63, which is close to 30 but not over.\n\nSo the text says temperatures range from 24 to 30. The data shows a low of about 24.47 and high of 29.94. So technically, it's accurate as 24-30 covers that range.\n\nWait, but in the data, on '2025-02-06 00:00:00', temp is 24.47°C, which is just above 24. The text says \"from 26 to 29\" on the first day and overall from 24 to 30. Wait, no, the text's first sentence about the first day says temperatures range from 26-29, but according to data, on the first day (2025-02-03), the temp ranges from 25.7°C at 18:00 up to 29.01 at 06:00. So the actual range is about 25.7 to 29.01, which is within 26-29 as stated.\n\nWait, but looking again, on '2025-02-03', main.temp at 00:00 is 26.68, at 06:00 it's 29.01, at 12:00 it's 26.75, and at 18:00 it's 25.7. So the lowest on that day is 25.7, which is just below 26. The text says \"ranging from 26 to 29,\" which is slightly higher than the actual low of 25.7. This could be a minor error but perhaps negligible.\n\nWait another point: On '2025-02-06', at 00:00, temp is 24.47°C, which is below 26. So when the text says \"temperatures ranging from 26 to 29 degrees Celsius\" on the first day, it's incorrect because the first day actually goes down to 25.7. But wait, no—the first day is Monday (2025-02-03), and its lowest temp is 25.7, which is just below 26. So the text says \"ranging from 26 to 29,\" but it's actually 25.7 to 29.01. That's a minor discrepancy but could be considered an error.\n\nWait, perhaps I should check each part again:\n\n- The first day (Monday) has temps: 26.68, 29.01, 26.75, 25.7. So the range is 25.7 to 29.01. The text says \"ranging from 26 to 29,\" which excludes the lower value of 25.7. That's a contradiction because the data shows it goes below 26.\n\nSo that would be an error: Contradictory, as the text states higher low than actual.\n\nAnother point: On Wednesday (2025-02-05), there is moderate rain at 00:00 but also light rain at 12:00 and overcast clouds elsewhere. The text says \"Wednesday is expected to bring moderate rain,\" which is correct because it does have a period of moderate rain, even if not all day.\n\nWait, another possible error: The text mentions that on the first day, there's light rain in the morning and evening. Looking at the data for Monday (2025-02-03), the times are 00:00 (midnight), 06:00 (morning), 12:00 (noon), and 18:00 (evening). The weather descriptions are:\n\n- 00:00: light rain\n- 06:00: light rain\n- 12:00: overcast clouds\n- 18:00: light rain\n\nSo the text says \"light rain in the morning and evening,\" which corresponds to 06:00 and 18:00. That's accurate because those times do have light rain, even though there's also rain at midnight.\n\nWait, but the data shows that on Monday, it rains three times: midnight, morning, and evening. The text only mentions morning and evening, omitting midnight. Is this an error? It depends on whether \"morning\" is considered to include midnight or not. Typically, morning is around 06:00, so midnight is late night. So the text might be missing the midnight rain, but it's not necessarily wrong because it's focusing on the main parts of the day.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the text is misleading by implying that rain occurs only in the morning and evening when in fact it also rains at midnight. But since midnight is part of the same day, maybe it's included in \"evening\" or just considered as late night. This might be a point to consider but may not rise to the level of an error.\n\nAnother possible error: The text says that on Thursday and Friday, there's a decrease in precipitation with some broken clouds and few clouds. Looking at Thursday (2025-02-06), it has light rain at 06:00 and overcast or broken clouds otherwise. On Friday (2025-02-07), the only rain is at 18:00 on Friday? Wait, no—looking at Friday's data points:\n\n- 00:00: few clouds\n- 06:00: overcast clouds\n- 12:00: broken clouds\n- 18:00: overcast clouds\n\nWait, actually, in the data provided, for '2025-02-07', which is Friday, there's no rain mentioned except perhaps at 18:00? Wait, checking each entry:\n\nLooking back, I see that on '2025-02-06 06:00:00' (Thursday morning), it's light rain. On Friday, the data points are:\n\n- 00:00: few clouds\n- 06:00: overcast clouds\n- 12:00: broken clouds\n- 18:00: overcast clouds\n\nSo no rain on Friday except maybe none. Wait, looking at '2025-02-07 06:00:00', the weather is overcast clouds with no rain. So the text says \"Thursday and Friday will see a decrease in precipitation,\" which is correct because Thursday has less rain than Wednesday, and Friday has even less or none.\n\nWait, but on Thursday (2025-02-06), there's light rain at 06:00, so it's not completely dry. The text mentions \"some periods of broken clouds and few clouds,\" which is accurate as the data shows those conditions.\n\nAnother point to check: The text says that throughout the period, winds are generally light (1-4 m/s). Looking at wind speeds:\n\n- Most days have wind speeds between 0.41 up to about 5.25 m/s.\n- So saying \"around 1-4\" is mostly accurate but there are instances where it's slightly above or below.\n\nHowever, the text uses \"generally,\" which implies that most of the time it's within that range, so this seems acceptable.\n\nNow, considering all these points, I think the main error lies in the temperature range stated for the first day. The text says 26-29°C, but according to data, it goes down to 25.7°C on the evening of the first day (18:00). So that's a contradiction because the low is lower than what the text states.\n\nAnother possible error could be in the wind speed range if we consider that some days have higher speeds, like up to 5.25 m/s, which is above 4. But since it's only one instance and the rest are within 1-4, maybe it's not a major issue.\n\nSo, compiling this:\n\nThe text states temperatures on the first day range from 26-29°C, but data shows a low of 25.7°C. This is contradictory.", "annotator_group": 0}

The text might be exaggerating by saying \"partly cloudy,\" which isn't supported by the data. This could be misleading because it implies more cloud cover than actually present.\n\nI don't see any other discrepancies.

So, it's not entirely accurate to say \"mostly overcast\" since one day has less cloud cover.\n\nNext part: \"chance of light rain on Wednesday and Friday.\" Checking the data, Wednesday does have light rain (3.63 mm at 06:00:00). However, Friday only shows overcast clouds without any rain mentioned. So mentioning rain on Friday is incorrect.\n\nMoving to temperatures: The text says they range from 24°C to 27°C during the day.

However, on Wednesday (Feb 5th) afternoon and Thursday (Feb 6th), there are clear skies mentioned.

On Feb 5th at 12:00, it's 9.45°C, which is above 7°C.

However, the feels_like on Tuesday at 06:00 is 36.5°C, which is quite high. This might be misleading because it feels much hotter than the actual temp.\n\n3. \"There's a chance of occasional showers on Wednesday and Friday, but overall precipitation levels are expected to be moderate.\"\n- Looking at rain values:\n- Wednesday has rain up to 2.01 mm/h (6h), which is light.\n- Friday has some rain, especially on the 7th at 06:00 with 1.69 mm/h (6h).\n- However, other days like Monday and Tuesday also have significant rain, e.g., Monday 18:00 has 3.07 mm/h (6h), which is more than moderate.\n- The text mentions showers only on Wednesday and Friday but doesn't account for the heavier rains on other days.\n\nNow, classifying these observations:\n\n- The first point about \"mostly overcast\" might be misleading because not every day is overcast; some have fewer clouds. So this could fall under Misleading (2) as it leaves out that there are clearer days.\n\n- The temperature part mentions a narrower range but doesn't account for the higher feels-like temperatures, which could make the statement misleading. However, since the text refers to actual temps and not feels-like, maybe it's accurate. But the high feels-like might be worth noting as Misleading because people perceive temperature differently.\n\n- The precipitation section is misleading because it focuses only on Wednesday and Friday, ignoring other days with more significant rain. This could also be Misleading (2).\n\nWait, but looking back at the data, the text says \"throughout the week\" for overcast skies, which isn't entirely true as Friday starts with few clouds. So that's a Misleading statement.\n\nThe temperature part: The feels-like on Tuesday is 36.5°C, which is quite high, but the text mentions temps around 25-26°C during the day. That seems contradictory because the actual temp is 29.5°C at 06:00 on Tuesday, which is higher than 26°C. So that's a Contradictory error (0).\n\nThe precipitation part: The text says \"occasional showers\" only on Wednesday and Friday but misses the heavier rains on Monday and Tuesday. This is misleading because it doesn't give the full picture, so Misleading (2).\n\nWait, but in the data, the rain values are given as mm/h over 6h. So for example, on Monday at 18:00, it's 3.07 mm/h (6h), which totals about 18.42 mm over 6 hours. That's more than moderate. The text says \"overall precipitation levels are expected to be moderate,\" but in reality, some periods have higher rain, so this is misleading.\n\nSo, I think there are three errors:\n\n1.

So this is Misleading (2).\n- The temperature during the day on Tuesday is higher than stated, which is Contradictory (0).\n- The precipitation is more significant on some days beyond Wednesday and Friday, making the statement about showers misleading (2).\n\nTherefore, three annotations: two Misleading and one Contradictory.", "annotator_group": 0}

Checking the data, Wednesday does have rain on the 12th and 18th, but Thursday only has overcast clouds without rain except at noon with 5 mm.

So that seems correct.\n\n5. **Winds**: The wind speeds vary but average around 3-10 m/s, which is moderate. Directions vary but generally from NE to SW as stated. However, looking deeper, the wind directions aren't consistently from NE to SW every day. For example, on Monday at 00:00, it's 29 degrees (NE), but by 06:00, it's 51 degrees (more northerly). So the direction isn't a straight NE-SW; it varies more widely. This could be misleading as it implies a consistent direction when in reality it fluctuates.\n\n6. **Repetition**: The text doesn't seem to repeat any information unnecessarily.\n\n7. **Other Issues**: No obvious contradictions or incoherent phrasing. All statements are technically correct but let's check for any distortions.\n\nWait, the wind direction part might be misleading because it suggests a consistent NE-SW pattern, while data shows more variability. So that could be an error of type 2: Misleading.\n\nI don't see other errors. The rest seems to align with the data without contradictions or uncheckable claims.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me start by understanding both the data and the text.\n\nFirst, looking at the data structure, it contains weather information for El Cazadero from Monday to Friday. Each day has four time slots with details like temperature, feels_like, pressure, wind speed, gusts, and weather descriptions.\n\nThe user's text states that temperatures range from 13°C to 24°C over five days. I'll check the data to see if this is accurate. Scanning through each day's temp values:\n\n- Monday: temps around 23.74, 15.06, 7.69, 21.02.\n- Tuesday: 24.72, 16.83, 7.34, 21.78.\n- Wednesday: 24.78, 13.54, 9.73, 21.27.\n- Thursday: 23.75, 15.74, 11.43, 22.31.\n- Friday: 24.03, 14.78, 11.45, 21.71.\n\nThe lowest temp is 7.34°C on Tuesday at noon, and the highest is 24.78°C on Wednesday at midnight. So the text's range of 13°C to 24°C doesn't include the lower temps like 7.34°C. That means the temperature range in the text is incorrect because it misses the colder temperatures.\n\nNext, the text mentions a slight chance of clouds on Wednesday. Looking at Wednesday's data: at 06:00, clouds are 1%, which is mostly clear, and other times are 0%. So the text is correct about possible clouds but maybe overstates it as \"a slight chance\" when it's minimal.\n\nThe wind part says gusts can reach up to 5.23 m/s on Friday. Checking Friday's data: at 00:00, wind speed is 4.45 m/s with a gust of 5.23 m/s. So that part is accurate.\n\nPutting this together, the main error is the temperature range being too narrow. The text doesn't mention the lower temperatures, which makes it misleading because it gives a false impression of warmer days than reality.", "annotator_group": 0}

The data shows that both halftime and fulltime scores were 2-2 for Vila Nova and Ituano respectively, but there's no extratime since both 'extratime' fields are None. So the text mentioning \"extra time\" is incorrect because the game didn't go into extra time; it ended in regular time after 90 minutes.\n\nNext, the winning goal. The data indicates that Ituano scored at 84', 90'+9', and 90'+12'. José Aldo's goal was at 6' and 87', but he received a yellow card at 87'. The winner was actually Vinícius Paiva at 90'+9', so the text incorrectly credits José Aldo with the winner.\n\nThen, substitutions. Vila Nova made five substitutions (at 41',50',71',72', and one more), and Ituano made five as well (46',61',75',81'). The text says Ituano used six, which is a mistake.\n\nLastly, red cards. The data only shows yellow cards for both teams; there's no red card mentioned. The text incorrectly states that Richard from Vila Nova received a red card in added time.\n\nSo I have four errors to classify: contradictory for extra time and red cards, misleading for substitutions, and contradictory again for the winning goal.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the text carefully and compare it against the data to spot any discrepancies or issues.\n\nThe text starts by mentioning the match details: date, location, teams, and round number. That seems accurate based on the data provided.\n\nNext, it talks about the halftime scores being zero each. The data confirms that both home and away had 0 at halftime, so that's correct.\n\nThen, the text mentions extra time with no additional goals. Looking at the data, 'extratime' has None for both teams, which means there was no extra time played. So referring to \"extra time\" is incorrect because the match ended after full time without going into extra time. That's a mistake.\n\nMoving on, substitutions are detailed. The text says Napier City Rovers had five substitutes at 46', 61', 65' twice, and 78'. Checking the data, I see that Napier made substitutions at 46', 65', 77', 86', and another at 86'. So the timings mentioned in the text don't match exactly. For example, 61' isn't a substitution time for Napier; it's Auckland's. Also, 78' is actually an away substitution, not home. This seems like a mix-up of substitution times between the teams.\n\nRegarding Auckland City, the text states they had four changes at 61', 65', and mentions D. Manickum and M. Bevan. The data shows substitutions at 61', 65', 78', and 90'. Wait, no, looking again: the events list has substitutions for Auckland at 61', 65' (twice), and 78', which is four substitutions in total. So that part seems correct.\n\nThe text also mentions that S. Ukich scored at the 90th minute, leading to a 1-0 win. The data confirms this with the goal event at 90'.\n\nNow, let's classify these errors:\n\n1. The mention of \"extra time\" is incorrect because the match didn't go into extra time. This seems like a contradiction since the data shows extratime as None, so it's a Contradictory error (type 0).\n\n2. The substitution times for Napier City Rovers are inaccurate. They had substitutions at different times than what's stated in the text. This could fall under Misleading (type 2) because it distorts the actual substitution timeline.\n\n3. The text says Auckland City made substitutions at 61', 65', and mentions two players, but according to the data, they actually had four substitutions, including another at 78'. However, upon closer look, the data does show four substitutions for Auckland: 61', 65' (twice), and 78'. So maybe that part is accurate. Wait, no, in the text it says \"Auckland City also saw four changes with players coming in from minutes 61', 65', 'substituting D. Manickum and M. Bevan among others.\" That seems correct because they did have substitutions at those times.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscounted earlier. Let me recount the substitutions:\n\nFor Napier (home):\n- 46' G. Andrew\n- 65' M. Chretien\n- 77' E. Richards\n- 86' J. Annear\n- 86' C. Emerson\n\nSo that's five substitutions at 46', 65', 77', and two at 86'. The text says Napier had substitutes at 46', 61', 65' twice, and 78'. So the times are incorrect; they didn't have a sub at 61' or 78'.\n\nFor Auckland (away):\n- 61' K. Gould\n- 65' M. Bevan\n- 65' D. Manickum\n- 78' Gerard Garriga\n\nSo four substitutions, which matches the text's statement of four changes.\n\nTherefore, the error is in Napier's substitution times being listed as 46', 61', 65' twice, and 78'. The correct times are 46', 65', 77', and two at 86'.\n\nThis makes the text misleading because it incorrectly states the substitution times for Napier City Rovers. So that's a Misleading error (type 2).\n\nAdditionally, the mention of extra time is incorrect, which is a Contradictory error.\n\nI don't see any other errors in the text upon reviewing again.", "annotator_group": 0}

So, the home team scored once, away twice.\n\nNow, reading the text:\n\nThe game started with no goals until halftime when Rhode Island scored through N. Dossantos' own goal at 43'. That's correct because data shows an own goal by Dossantos at 43'.\n\nThen it mentions substitutions involving Z. Herivaux and J. Williams entering for M. Doyle and C. Holstad. Wait, checking the data: At 45'+3, Rhode Island's Z. Herivaux got a yellow card. The substitution for Herivaux happened later at 90' when K. Twumasi came in. Also, substitutions for Charleston Battery were at 46', not Rhode Island. So this part is incorrect because it's mixing up the teams and timing.\n\nNext, the text says Charleston equalized with N. Markanich's goal at 52'. But data shows their goal was by J. Torres at 61', so that's a mistake. Also, the text mentions another normal score from J. Torres after 52', which is correct but misplaces the timing.\n\nIt then talks about substitutions continuing, mentioning E. Ycaza and P. Saydee for Charleston, which is accurate as they subbed in at 64' and 80'. But it also says J. Brito substituted C. Holstad at 76', which is right because that's when Rhode Island made that change.\n\nThe text states Rhode Island scored again through N. Fuson assisted by C. Holstad at 53'. That's correct as per data, but the timing in the text seems off since it was after Charleston's goal, which actually happened later.\n\nFinally, the conclusion says Charleston maintained their lead and won, but according to data, Rhode Island won 2-1.

Let me go through each part of the text step by step.\n\nFirst, the text mentions that Wednesday will have fog and mist in the early hours leading to sunny conditions with a peak temp of 9.45°C. Looking at the data for Wednesday, I see that at 00:00, it's foggy, then mist at 06:00, but by 12:00, it's clear sky. The temperature does reach around 9.45°C, so that part is correct.\n\nNext, on Thursday, the text says it starts clear and becomes cloudy by evening with temps dropping to 6°C. Checking the data, Thursday indeed starts clear but ends with overcast clouds. However, the lowest temp mentioned in the data for Thursday is 5.38°C at 00:00, not 6°C as stated. So that's a discrepancy.\n\nThen, on Friday, the text mentions light rain in the afternoon and evening with temps falling to 2°C. The data shows rain starting at 12:00 (light rain) and continuing into the evening. However, the lowest temp is 2.08°C at 18:00, which rounds to about 2°C. Wait, but earlier on Friday at 06:00, it's 3.9°C, so maybe the text is accurate there.\n\nWait, no, looking again, the data for Friday has temps at 12:00 as 3.82°C and 18:00 as 2.08°C. So the text says \"falling to 2°C,\" which matches the data. But wait, in the data, on Friday at 06:00, it's 3.9°C, so maybe the text is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Thursday had a temp of 5.38°C, but the text says 6°C. So that's an error because 5.38 is lower than 6. So the text might be incorrect there.\n\nAnother point: The text mentions \"light precipitation\" for Friday, which matches the data showing light rain and drizzle. But wait, in the data, on Tuesday at 18:00, it's light drizzle, but the text doesn't mention that. It only talks about Wednesday's fog and mist, Thursday's transition, and Friday's rain.\n\nWait, looking back, the text says \"occasional clear skies\" over five days. The data shows clear skies on Wednesday (12:00 and 18:00), Thursday (00:00 and 06:00), so that's correct.\n\nAnother possible error: The text states that on Friday, temperatures fall to 2°C. In the data, at 18:00 on Friday, it's 2.08°C, which is about 2°C. So that seems accurate.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Thursday's temp was 5.38°C, but the text says it drops to around 6°C. That might be a minor discrepancy, but perhaps within acceptable rounding. Alternatively, maybe the data shows lower temps on other days.\n\nWait, looking again: On Friday at 06:00, it's 3.9°C, and at 12:00, 3.82°C, then 2.08°C at 18:00. So the lowest is 2.08°C, which rounds to 2°C as in the text.\n\nWait, but on Thursday, the data shows at 00:00 it's 5.38°C, and at 06:00, 4.56°C, then 7.06°C at 12:00 (which is higher), so the lowest on Thursday is around 4.56°C, not 6°C as stated in the text. So that's an error because the text says it drops to 6°C, but data shows lower.\n\nWait no, wait: The text says \"temperatures dropping to around 6°C\" on Thursday evening. But looking at the data for Thursday:\n\n- 00:00: 5.38°C\n- 06:00: 4.56°C (feels like 1.56°C)\n- 12:00: 7.06°C\n- 18:00: 6.42°C\n\nSo the lowest on Thursday is 4.56°C, but the text says it drops to around 6°C in the evening. However, at 18:00, it's 6.42°C, which is close to 6°C. So maybe that's acceptable as rounding.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me check each day again:\n\n- Monday and Tuesday: Overcast with temps from 4°C to 11°C. Data shows Monday's temp around 4°C, Tuesday peaks at 11.13°C. Correct.\n- Wednesday: Fog, mist, then clear. Temps peak at 9.45°C. Correct.\n- Thursday: Starts clear, ends cloudy. Temps drop to around 6°C. Data shows 6.42°C at 18:00, so that's accurate.\n- Friday: Overcast with light rain and temps to 2°C. Data shows 2.08°C at 18:00, correct.\n\nWait, then where is the error? The initial thought was about Thursday's temp, but it seems okay. Maybe I missed something else.\n\nLooking again, perhaps the text says \"light precipitation\" as occasional, but in data, there's light drizzle on Tuesday evening and rain on Friday. So maybe the text should mention that precipitation starts earlier than Friday.\n\nWait, the text says \"occasional clear skies and light precipitation.\" The data shows precipitation on Tuesday (drizzle) and Friday (rain). So perhaps the text is missing that it rains on Tuesday as well, making the statement about precipitation incorrect because it's not just on Friday.\n\nSo the error would be that the text doesn't mention Tuesday's drizzle, which is a form of light precipitation. Therefore, the text is misleading by omitting that there's precipitation on Tuesday as well, not just Friday.\n\nAnother possible error: The text says \"over the next five days,\" but the data goes from Monday to Friday, which is five days (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday). So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps another point: The text mentions \"light winds increasing slightly by Tuesday evening.\" Looking at wind speeds:\n\n- Monday 00:00: 2.57 m/s\n- Tuesday 18:00: 4.63 m/s (evening)\nSo yes, wind increases from Monday to Tuesday evening.\n\nAnother possible error: The text says on Wednesday, \"fog and mist in the early hours giving way to sunny conditions.\" Data shows fog at 00:00, mist at 06:00, then clear sky at 12:00. So that's correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm missing something else. Let me check each part again.\n\nAh! The text says \"Wednesday will bring clearer skies... temperatures peaking at 9.45°C.\" But in the data, on Wednesday at 12:00, it's clear sky with temp 9.45°C, which is correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating and there are no errors. But that can't be right because the user expects some annotations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the text says \"light precipitation\" but in data, on Tuesday evening (18:00), it's light drizzle, so the text should mention that as well. Therefore, the text is misleading by not including Tuesday's precipitation, making the statement about precipitation incomplete.\n\nSo the error would be type 2: Misleading because it omits Tuesday's precipitation, which is part of the data.", "annotator_group": 0}

Each day has details like cloud cover, temperature, feels-like temperature, wind speed, and precipitation.\n\nThe generated text mentions that temperatures range from 24.47°C to 29.5°C. I'll check the data to see if this is accurate. Scanning through each entry in 'list', I find the minimum temp is around 24.47°C on Thursday at 00:00, which matches. The maximum temp is 29.5°C on Tuesday at 06:00, so that part seems correct.\n\nNext, the text states the highest \"feels-like\" temperature is 36.5°C on Tuesday morning. Checking the data for Tuesday, specifically the entry with 'dt_txt' as '2025-02-04 06:00:00', the feels_like value is indeed 36.5°C. That seems accurate.\n\nThe text also mentions that the heaviest rain is expected on Tuesday evening at 5.2 mm. Looking through the data, on Tuesday at 18:00, the rain value is exactly 5.2 mm. So that's correct too.\n\nNow, checking for any contradictory or misleading information. The text says \"predominantly overcast skies\" and mentions a decrease in cloud cover by Friday with broken and few clouds. From the data, most days have 100% cloud cover except towards the end. On Friday at 12:00, clouds are 78%, which is 'broken clouds', so that part aligns.\n\nI don't see any instances where the text contradicts the data or presents unverifiable information.

No error here.\n\n2. **Monday's Weather**: It mentions broken and scattered clouds with a peak temp of 31.3°C. Checking the data for Monday:\n- At 06:00, it's overcast clouds (description: 'overcast clouds') but the text says broken and scattered. Wait, no—the first entry is at 00:00 with broken clouds, then 06:00 overcast, 12:00 scattered. So maybe the text is combining these? It might be misleading because it simplifies varying cloud conditions as just \"broken and scattered.\" But I'm not sure if that's a significant error.\n\n3. **Rain Start on Tuesday Afternoon**: The data shows rain starting on Wednesday (2025-02-05 00:00) with 'light rain' and continues. So the text says rain begins on Tuesday afternoon, but according to the data, it starts on Wednesday. That seems contradictory because Tuesday's entries don't have rain; the first rain is on Wednesday at 00:00.\n\n4. **Heaviest Rainfall of 5 mm on Thursday Afternoon**: The data shows on Thursday at 12:00, the rain is 5 mm. So that part is correct.\n\n5. **Winds Strengthening to 12.76 m/s by Friday**: Looking at the wind speeds, the highest gust is 12.76 m/s on Wednesday (2025-02-05 12:00). The text says it reaches this speed by Friday, but according to data, it's reached earlier. So that's a contradictory statement.\n\n6. **Temperature Range from 24.49°C to 31.3°C**: Checking the temps, the lowest is around 24.49°C (Wednesday 18:00) and highest 31.3°C (Monday 06:00). That seems accurate.\n\n7. **Slight Cooling Trend Toward the End of the Week**: The temperatures do show a slight decrease from mid-week onwards, so that's correct.\n\nNow, identifying errors:\n\n- **Rain Start Date**: Text says Tuesday afternoon, data shows Wednesday. This is contradictory (annotation_type 0).\n\n- **Wind Speed Timing**: Text mentions reaching 12.76 m/s by Friday, but it happens on Wednesday.

Each forecast entry has details like clouds, day of the week, datetime, main metrics (feels_like, pressure, temp), weather description, and wind details.\n\nNext, I'll read through the generated text to see how it represents this data. The text mentions that the weather will be predominantly clear with no significant cloud cover.

This could fall under the 'Misleading' category since it's technically true but omits some information.\n\n2. **Temperature Ranges**: The text states daytime temps from 21°C to 24°C and nighttime as low as 7°C to 16°C. Looking at the data, the highest temp is around 24.78°C, which fits, but the lowest feels_like is 7.34°C. However, another entry has a feels_like of 9.14°C, so saying \"as low as\" might be slightly misleading because it's not clear if that's the absolute minimum or just one instance.\n\n3. **Wind Gusts**: The text mentions gusts up to 5.23 m/s on Friday. Checking the data, this is accurate for the Friday entry at 00:00. So no issue here.\n\n4. **Pressure Fluctuation**: The text says pressure ranges from 1012 hPa to 1020 hPa.

Then Ituano responded with goals from Salatiel and Vinícius Paiva. Wait, in the data, Salatiel didn't score; it was actually Leozinho who scored again at 84', and Vinícius Paiva scored at 90'+9'. So there's a mistake here—Salatiel wasn't a goalscorer.\n\nThe text mentions numerous substitutions and yellow cards. The data indeed shows multiple substitution events (e.g., Emerson Urso, Guilherme Lazaroni) and several yellow cards for both teams, so that part is correct.\n\nLastly, the VAR decision in the 90th minute disallowing Ituano's goal due to offside is correctly mentioned. Marcelo Mineiro had a goal disallowed at 90'+2', which matches the data.\n\nSo, the main error I found is the incorrect attribution of Salatiel as a goalscorer. The text should have mentioned Leozinho instead. This falls under the 'Contradictory' category because it directly contradicts the provided data.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me break down how I approached this.\n\nFirst, I read through the data provided. It includes details about a football match between Auckland City and Napier City Rovers. The data shows that Auckland won 1-0 with the goal scored by S. Ukich in the 90th minute. There were several substitutions from both teams, with Napier making five and Auckland four.\n\nNext, I looked at the generated text. It mentions a narrow 1-0 victory, the venue, the scoreless first half, the decisive goal, substitutions, and the referee. My task is to check if this text has any errors based on the given categories: contradictory, not checkable, misleading, incoherent, repetitive, or other.\n\nI started by comparing each statement in the text against the data. The scoreline matches, so no issue there. The venue and teams are correct too. The goal was indeed scored in the 90th minute by S. Ukich, which aligns with the data.\n\nLooking at substitutions, the data shows Napier made five substitutions (at 46', 65', 77', 86', 86') and Auckland made four (61', 65', 78', 90'). The text correctly states that Napier made five and Auckland four. So no error there either.\n\nI checked for any contradictory or misleading information but didn't find any.

Dossantos in the 43rd minute. The data shows that event: time \"43'\", type 'Goal', detail 'Own Goal' by Rhode Island's N. Dossantos. Wait, but in the text, it says Charleston's N. Dossantos scored the own goal. That must be a mistake because according to the data, he plays for Rhode Island.\n\nThen, the text mentions that after halftime, Rhode Island extended their lead with Fuson's goal at 53', assisted by Holstad. The data confirms this event: time \"53'\", team Rhode Island, player N. Fuson, assist C. Holstad. So that part is correct.\n\nCharleston responded with a goal from J. Torres in the 61st minute. Data shows this too: time \"61'\", team Charleston Battery, player J. Torres, type 'Goal'. Correct again.\n\nThe text also notes several yellow cards and substitutions, which are all detailed in the data's events section. The referee is correctly named as C.

Rocca' with type 'Goal'. So that's correct.\n\nThen, the text states FAS turned the game around in the second half. Looking at the score breakdown, halftime was 0-1 (FAS scored 0, Alianza 1) and fulltime 4-1. So yes, FAS did turn it around in the second half. That seems accurate.\n\nE. Villar is noted as scoring four goals at 57th, 61st, 66th, and 71st minutes. Checking the events: E. Villar scored at 57', 61', 66', and 71'.

Data shows status 'elapsed' as 90 and the referee is indeed E. Martínez. So that's accurate too.\n\nWait a second, looking back at the substitutions for FAS: in the data, there are five substitutions, but in the text it says \"responding with five of their own.\" That seems correct because both made five each.\n\nI don't see any contradictions or inaccuracies here.

That all aligns with the data. So far, no issues here.\n\nThe text also mentions that Jalapa made several substitutions but didn't score, which is accurate as per the events listed. The conclusion states Diriangén won 6-0, maintaining their strong form.\n\nI need to check each part of the text against the data to spot any errors. Let's go sentence by sentence:\n\n1. \"Diriangén secured a dominant 6-0 victory...\" - Correct.\n2. \"...opened scoring in 25th minute through O.
