Let me go through each part of the text step by step.\n\nFirst, the text mentions that Ituano won 4-3 against Vila Nova in a Serie B match at Estádio Onésio Brasileiro Alvarenga. Checking the data, the 'goals' section indeed shows home:3 and away:4, so that's correct.\n\nNext, the first half ended 2-2. The data's 'score' under 'halftime' confirms this with home:2 and away:2, so no issue there.\n\nLooking at the goalscorers in the text: José Aldo and Leozinho for Ituano, Alesson and Luciano Naninho for Vila Nova. The data lists events where these players scored at times 6', 18', 34', and 37'. That matches up, so no problem here.\n\nIn the second half, Jemmes scored for Vila Nova at 56', which is correct according to the data. Then, Ituano's goals from Salatiel at 84' and Vinícius Paiva in stoppage time (90'+9'). The data shows these events as well, so that's accurate.\n\nThe text mentions numerous substitutions and yellow cards, both of which are evident in the data with multiple 'subst' and 'Card' events. So that part is fine.\n\nNow, the VAR decision: the text says it disallowed a goal for Ituano due to offside in the 90th minute. The data has an event at \"90' +2\" where a goal was disallowed for offside by Marcelo Mineiro of Ituano. However, the text doesn't specify the player, just the team. Since it's accurate that Ituano had a goal disallowed, but the omission of the player might be misleading because it could imply another player or situation. This seems like a Misleading error as it leaves out specific details.\n\nI don't see any other discrepancies. The rest of the text aligns with the data provided.", "annotator_group": 0}

The goal was scored by S. Ukich in the 90th minute. The venue was Bluewater Stadium in Napier, and the referee was M. Roil.\n\nNow, examining the text: It mentions a narrow 1-0 victory for Auckland City at Bluewater Stadium. That's correct. The game was goalless in the first half, which aligns with the data showing halftime scores as 0-0.\n\nThe decisive moment is correctly noted as S. Ukich's goal in the 90th minute. However, I notice that the text says \"90th minute,\" but in football, it's more common to say \"90th minute\" rather than \"the 90th minute.\" Wait, no, actually both are correct grammatically. Maybe that's not an error.\n\nLooking at substitutions: The data shows Napier City Rovers made five substitutions (at 46', 65', 77', 86', and 86') and Auckland City made four substitutions (61', 65', 78', and 90'). The text states Napier made five and Auckland four, which matches the data. So that part is accurate.\n\nThe match duration: Data shows elapsed time as 90 minutes with 10 extra minutes, but the status is 'Match Finished' after 90 minutes. The text says it concluded after 90 minutes of regular time, which is correct because extra time isn't mentioned in the data as being played beyond 90; perhaps the extra 10 were stoppage time.\n\nWait, no, looking again: The data's 'status' has \"elapsed\": 90 and \"extra\": 10. So total time was 100 minutes, but the match ended at 90 with a 10-minute extra period? Or maybe it's just that the game went into extra time. But in the text, it says concluded after 90 minutes of regular time, which might be misleading because there were extra minutes. However, since the score is final at fulltime (1-0), perhaps the extra time wasn't played beyond 90. So maybe the text is correct.\n\nWait, no: The 'status' shows \"elapsed\": 90 and \"extra\":10, but in football, extra time usually refers to after 90 minutes. But if the match ended at 90 with a result, maybe the extra was stoppage time. I'm not sure, but perhaps the text is correct.\n\nAnother point: The referee's name is M. Roil in both data and text, so that's accurate.\n\nWait, looking back, the text says \"concluded after 90 minutes of regular time.\" But according to the data, 'elapsed' is 90, which includes stoppage time. So maybe it's correct as is.\n\nI don't see any contradictions or inaccuracies in the text based on the provided data.

The final score is 1-2 in favor of Rhode Island. The events show that the first goal was an own goal by N. Dossantos of Charleston in the 43rd minute. Then, in the 53rd minute, N. Fuson scored for Rhode Island, assisted by C. Holstad. Charleston's J. Torres scored in the 61st minute.\n\nNow, examining the text: It correctly states the final score and venue. The own goal is mentioned accurately as giving Rhode Island the lead at halftime. However, I notice that the text says \"Rhode Island secured a 2-1 victory,\" which is correct because they scored two goals. But in the data, the first goal was an own goal by Charleston, so technically, it's Rhode Island's goal but scored by the opponent.\n\nWait, no, the own goal counts as a goal for Rhode Island even though it was scored by a Charleston player. So that part is correct. The text mentions N. Fuson's goal in the 53rd minute, which aligns with the data. Then J. Torres scores in the 61st, making it 2-1.\n\nLooking further, the text states that Rhode Island extended their lead to 2-0 before Charleston scored. But according to the data, after the own goal (1-0), Fuson's goal made it 2-0, then Charleston scored once, so the final score is indeed 2-1. The text correctly reflects this.\n\nI also check for any other discrepancies. The text mentions several yellow cards and substitutions, which are present in the data. The referee's name matches as well.\n\nWait a second, the own goal is correctly attributed to N. Dossantos of Charleston, so that's accurate.

It only talks about the early lead but not the halftime score.

However, in the data, there's no goal by D. Bunch; instead, M. Patterson scores again at 90'+6', which is a penalty. So the text incorrectly attributes a goal to D.

Looking at the events, both players did score in the 18th and 34th minutes respectively, which is within the first half. So that's accurate.\n\nThen, Ituano's goals are attributed to José Aldo and Leozinho. From the data, José Aldo scored at 6', and Leozinho at 37'. Both are in the first half as well. The text correctly notes their contributions.\n\nIn the second half, Salatiel and Vinícius Paiva added goals for Ituano. Checking the events, Salatiel scored at 84' and Vinícius Paiva at 90'+9', which is indeed in the second half.

The match ultimately ended in a tie after 90 minutes plus 5 minutes of extra time.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare this text against the data provided.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- The goals are correctly listed as 2-2.\n- Events include an own goal by G. Córdoba (14'), J. Williams scoring (31'), Y. Delgadillo's penalty (49'), and another goal by J.

The Plum Gator 7 also supports various connectivity options, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS, and NFC, and is available in black and orange colors.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare each statement against the data provided.\n\n1. **Display**: The text mentions a 5.7-inch IPS LCD with 720x1440 resolution and Dragontrail Glass protection. Checking the data under 'Display', it matches exactly. So no issue here.\n\n2. **OS and Chipset**: It says Android 11 and Mediatek MT6761V/WE chipset, which aligns with the data. Correct.\n\n3. **CPU and GPU**: The text states quad-core 2.0 GHz Cortex-A53 CPU and PowerVR GE8300 GPU. Data confirms this under 'Platform'. No problem here.\n\n4. **Memory**: Text says 32GB internal storage expandable via microSDXC, with 3GB RAM. Data shows \"Internal: 32GB 3GB RAM\" and \"Card slot: microSDXC (dedicated slot)\". So correct.\n\n5. **Cameras**: 8MP main camera with LED flash and panorama, and a 5MP selfie camera. Data under 'Main Camera' and 'Selfie camera' matches this exactly. Correct.\n\n6. **Battery**: Non-removable Li-Po 5580 mAh battery is correctly mentioned as per data.\n\n7. **Connectivity**: Text lists Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, GPS, and NFC. Data under 'Comms' shows:\n- Wi-Fi: Yes with specific standards\n- Bluetooth 5.0\n- Positioning includes GPS, GLONASS, GALILEO, BDS\n- NFC is listed as \"Yes (market/region dependent)\"\n\nSo all mentioned are correct.\n\n8. **Colors**: Available in black and orange, which matches the data under 'Misc'.\n\nNow, looking for any discrepancies or omissions:\n\n- The text doesn't mention anything about water and dust resistance or drop protection. Data under 'Body' specifies IP69 rating, 1.5m for 35 min, MIL-STD-810H compliant. This is a significant feature missing in the text.\n\n- The data includes sensors like accelerometer, gyro, proximity, compass under 'Features', but the text doesn't mention these.\n\n- Under 'Sound', data shows both loudspeaker and 3.5mm jack as \"Yes\". The text doesn't mention the 3.5mm jack.\n\n- The data also mentions FM radio under 'Comms', which isn't in the text.\n\nSo, the text omits several details present in the data, making it incomplete. However, according to the instructions, I should only annotate if the text is incorrect or misleading based on the data. Since these are omissions but not contradictions, they might fall under \"Not checkable\" or \"Misleading\". But since the text doesn't contradict any data, perhaps \"Other\" is more appropriate for missing info.\n\nWait, no. The user's instruction says to classify errors where the text contradicts, can't be checked, is misleading, etc. Omissions don't necessarily fall into these unless they make the text misleading by omitting key info that changes context.\n\nIn this case, omitting IP69 rating and other features might be considered misleading because it doesn't present the full picture of the device's capabilities. So, I should annotate those omissions as \"Misleading\" since they leave out important information.\n\nBut wait, the user examples show that sometimes missing data is annotated as \"Not checkable\". Hmm. Alternatively, if the text claims something not in data, it's contradictory. If it doesn't mention but data does, maybe it's \"Other\".\n\nWait, looking back at the examples:\n\nIn Example #2, the text mentioned opportunities which weren't in data, so it was \"Not checkable\".\n\nHere, the text doesn't mention certain features that are present in data. So, perhaps these omissions aren't errors but rather incomplete information. However, according to the instructions, I should only annotate if I'm sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the text is correct as it is, and missing info isn't an error unless it's misleading.\n\nWait, the user instruction says: \"Misleading (The fact is technically true, but leaves out important information or otherwise distorts the context.)\"\n\nSo, omitting key features like water resistance could be considered misleading because it doesn't give a full picture. Therefore, I should annotate that as Misleading.\n\nSimilarly, not mentioning sensors, 3.5mm jack, FM radio are omissions that might mislead by omission.\n\nBut in the text provided, these aren't mentioned at all. So perhaps each of these is a separate annotation.\n\nWait, but the user example shows that sometimes multiple points are annotated as separate entries.\n\nSo, I'll need to identify each missing key feature and create an annotation for each.\n\nHowever, considering the instructions say to annotate only what you're sure about, maybe it's better to note the most significant omission, like water resistance, as misleading.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the text is correct in what it includes, but just incomplete. Since the user didn't ask us to check for completeness, only errors based on data.\n\nWait, no. The task is to identify errors where the text contradicts or can't be verified by data, etc.\n\nSo, if the text doesn't mention something that's in data, unless it's a contradiction, it might not be an error. Unless the omission makes the statement misleading.\n\nFor example, if the device has IP69 rating but the text doesn't mention it, and the text says \"durable\", then it would be misleading. But here, the text just describes features without claiming durability beyond what's stated.\n\nSo perhaps the omissions don't constitute errors under the given categories because they're not contradictions or unverifiable statements.\n\nWait, but in Example #2, the text mentioned opportunities that weren't in data, making it \"Not checkable\". Similarly, if the text here doesn't mention something that is in data, maybe it's not an error unless it's claiming something false.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the text is accurate as written and doesn't include certain details but isn't wrong. So no annotations are needed.\n\nWait, looking back at Example #3, they annotated missing info as \"Other\" because it was a reason not covered by other categories.\n\nIn this case, since the data includes more features than what's in the text, perhaps each omission is an error of type \"Other\".\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let me think again.\n\nThe task is to find errors where:\n\n- Contradicts data (Contradictory)\n- Can't be checked from data (Not checkable)\n- Technically true but misleading\n- Incoherent\n- Repetitive\n- Other\n\nIn the given text, all statements are correct as per data. There's no contradiction or uncheckable info. The only issue is that some data points aren't mentioned.\n\nBut according to the instructions, I should only annotate if the text has an error based on the data. Since the text doesn't have any incorrect facts, just incomplete ones, perhaps there are no errors to annotate.\n\nWait, but in Example #3, they annotated omissions as \"Other\" because it was about availability, which wasn't covered elsewhere.\n\nIn this case, maybe omitting key features like water resistance is an error of type \"Misleading\", as it's a significant feature not mentioned. Alternatively, since the text doesn't claim anything about durability, perhaps it's just incomplete but not misleading.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating. Since all the text's statements are correct and there's no contradiction or uncheckable info, maybe there are no errors to annotate. So the output should be an empty list.", "annotator_group": 0}

However, starting Thursday, it's mostly overcast. So the text is accurate here.\n\n2. **Temperatures**: The text mentions temperatures fluctuating around mid-teens with a feels-like high of 16.47°C and low of 3.9°C.

So, the text mentions \"cloud coverage ranging from 86% up to full (100%)\", which seems accurate.\n\nNext, weather conditions: the data indicates light rain on multiple days and overcast clouds. The text says it alternates between light rain and various cloudiness, which matches the data.\n\nTemperature-wise, the data shows temperatures around 25-30°C, but the text states \"low twenties\". That's a discrepancy because low twenties would be around 20-23°C, while the data is higher.

However, the text also says \"remain relatively gentle\", but with such high gusts, \"gentle\" might be misleading. It's technically true but could be seen as distorting the context.\n\nRainfall: The data shows rainfall on several days, including up to 3.63 mm on Wednesday. The text mentions peaking yesterday evening with 1 mm and says it remains dry or lightly dampened today.

Thursday brings clearer skies, especially in the afternoon, with daytime temperatures reaching -1.91°C, but colder conditions return by the evening. Friday will have a mix of clear skies and broken clouds, with temperatures as low as -11.21°C in the morning and a high of -3°C during the day. Winds remain generally light throughout the period, with speeds mostly below 3 m/s.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare this text against the data provided to spot any discrepancies or issues.\n\nStarting with Monday:\n- The data shows that on Monday at 00:00, there's light snow and clouds at 99%, which matches \"light snow and mostly cloudy skies.\"\n- By evening (18:00), the data indicates clear sky (clouds 6%), so the transition to clearer conditions is correct.\n- Temperature drops to -4.14°C in the evening, which aligns with the text.\n\nMoving on to Tuesday:\n- The data shows scattered clouds on Tuesday morning and overcast by Wednesday. The text mentions \"scattered and overcast clouds\" for both days, which seems accurate.\n- Temperatures: On Tuesday night (00:00), it's -10.55°C, and during the day (12:00) on Wednesday, it's -2.23°C. The text correctly states this range.\n\nWednesday:\n- The data shows light snow at 12:00, which the text mentions as \"occasional light snow on Wednesday afternoon.\" That seems correct.\n- However, looking further into Wednesday evening (18:00), the data indicates overcast clouds but no mention of snow. So the text is accurate here.\n\nThursday:\n- The data shows clear skies in the afternoon (12:00) with a temperature of -1.91°C, which matches the text.\n- Evening temperatures drop to -7.95°C, so \"colder conditions return\" is correct.\n\nFriday:\n- Morning temperature is -11.21°C according to the data, matching the text's mention of \"-11.21°C in the morning.\"\n- Daytime high is -3°C, which aligns with the text.\n- Cloud cover: The data shows a mix of clear and broken clouds on Friday, so the text accurately describes this.\n\nWinds:\n- The data indicates wind speeds mostly below 3 m/s throughout the period. The text states \"winds remain generally light... mostly below 3 m/s,\" which is correct.\n\nNow, checking for any errors:\n\n1. **Temperature Range**: The text mentions temperatures from -11.21°C to -3°C. However, looking at the data, on Wednesday at 12:00, the temperature is -2.23°C, which is higher than -3°C. So the actual high is -2.23°C, not -3°C as stated in the text. This is a contradiction.\n\n2. **Snow Mention**: The text refers to \"occasional light snow on Wednesday afternoon,\" but checking the data for Wednesday at 12:00, it indeed shows light snow. However, I need to ensure that this isn't an error because the data supports it. Wait, no, the data does have light snow on Wednesday at 12:00, so the text is correct here.\n\n3. **Cloud Cover on Friday**: The text says \"a mix of clear skies and broken clouds,\" which matches the data showing 6% clouds (clear) in the afternoon and 79% (broken clouds) in the evening. So no error there.\n\n4. **Temperature on Thursday Evening**: The text mentions colder conditions returning, with a drop to -7.95°C, which is accurate according to the data.\n\n5. **Wind Speeds**: All wind speeds are below 3 m/s except for Wednesday at 12:00, which has a gust of 4.12 m/s but speed 2.65 m/s. So the text's statement about winds mostly below 3 m/s is correct.\n\nAfter reviewing each part, the only clear error is the temperature range stated in the text.

This discrepancy might be an error.\n\nThen, the text mentions rain expected on Thursday morning with light showers. The data shows rain starting from Thursday 00:00 and continuing through the day, so that part seems correct. But the temperatures mentioned for Thursday are around 7-8°C, which matches the data (e.g., 7.25°C at 00:00).\n\nLooking at Friday's description: \"temperatures peaking at 6.95°C.\" The data shows a high of 6.95°C on Friday at 12:00, so that's accurate. However, the text also mentions scattered clouds in the evening, which aligns with the data showing 44% clouds and 'scattered clouds' description.\n\nNow, checking for any other discrepancies. The text states \"mostly clear to partly cloudy skies\" on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings.

Temperatures will remain relatively stable, ranging from 24.49°C to 31.3°C, with a slight cooling trend toward the end of the week.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare each statement against the data provided.\n\n1. **Cloudy Conditions and Rain:**\nThe text mentions \"predominantly cloudy conditions\" and \"intermittent periods of light rain.\" Looking at the data, Sampiro does have various cloud cover, but there are specific times when it's overcast or broken clouds. However, the data shows that starting from Tuesday afternoon, there is consistent rain each day, not just intermittent. So this might be misleading because it downplays the frequency of the rain.\n\n2. **Monday's Weather:**\nThe text states Monday has \"broken and scattered clouds\" with temperatures peaking at 31.3°C and light winds. Checking the data for Monday:\n- At 06:00, it's overcast clouds (id 804), feels like 38.3°C.\n- At 12:00, scattered clouds, temp 26.94°C.\n- So, the peak on Monday is actually higher than stated, and winds are not light but around 4.32 m/s in the morning. This contradicts the text.\n\n3. **Rain Start and Intensity:**\nThe text says rain starts Tuesday afternoon with the heaviest on Thursday at 5 mm. Data shows:\n- Tuesday at 12:00 has 0.55 mm rain.\n- Wednesday at 12:00 has 1.88 mm, and so on, with Thursday at 12:00 having 5 mm. So the text is accurate here.\n\n4. **Wind Speeds:**\nThe text mentions winds reaching up to 12.76 m/s by Friday. Data shows a gust of 12.76 m/s on Friday at 12:00, but sustained speeds are lower. However, the text refers to \"winds\" in general, not specifying gusts, so this might be misleading as it could imply sustained winds that high.\n\n5. **Temperature Range:**\nThe text states temperatures range from 24.49°C to 31.3°C. Data shows a low of 24.49°C on Wednesday evening and a high of 31.3°C on Monday morning, so this is accurate.\n\n6. **Cooling Trend:**\nThe text mentions a slight cooling trend toward the end of the week.

This fits category 2 (Misleading).\n\n- **Incorrect Monday Peak Temp and Winds:** The actual peak was higher, and winds were stronger. This is a contradiction, so category 0.\n\n- **Wind Speed Misrepresentation:** Referring to gusts as general wind speed is misleading, category 2.\n\n- **Cooling Trend:** No actual cooling trend, so misleading, category 2.\n\nI need to structure these into the JSON format with reasons and text spans.", "annotator_group": 0}

Let me go through each part of the text step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the temperature description in the text: \"Daytime temperatures will range from around 21°C to 24°C, while nighttime temperatures will drop to as low as 7°C to 16°C.\" I'll check the data for each day's high and low temperatures.\n\nFrom the data, on Monday, the temps are 23.74°C (day) and 15.06°C (night). Tuesday has a high of 24.72°C and a low of 16.83°C. Wednesday shows a high of 24.78°C and a low of 13.54°C. Thursday's data is similar, with highs around 23-24°C and lows around 15-11°C. Friday also follows the same pattern.\n\nWait, I notice that the text mentions nighttime temperatures as low as 7°C, but looking through all the main temps in the data, the lowest I see is 7.34°C on Tuesday at noon, which is actually daytime. The nighttime lows are around 15-16°C, not dropping to 7°C. So the text incorrectly states a lower temp than what's in the data.\n\nNext, regarding precipitation: the text says \"calm and dry weather throughout the period.\" Checking the data, every entry under 'weather' has \"description\": \"clear sky\" except none mention rain or any precipitation. So that part seems accurate.\n\nLooking at wind speeds: the text mentions gusts up to 5.23 m/s on Friday. In the data, on Friday at 00:00, wind speed is 4.45 m/s with a gust of 5.23 m/s. That's correct, so no issue there.\n\nAtmospheric pressure in the text is stated as between 1012 hPa and 1020 hPa. The data shows pressures ranging from 1012 to 1020, which matches exactly. So that part is accurate.\n\nCloud cover: the text says \"no significant cloud cover,\" and indeed, all 'clouds' values in the data are 0 or 1, indicating clear skies. So no problem there.\n\nPutting it all together, the only error I found is the incorrect low temperature mentioned in the text. The data doesn't support a drop to 7°C at night; the lowest is around 15°C. Therefore, this is a contradictory error because it directly contradicts the data.", "annotator_group": 0}

The game ended with Ituano winning over Vila Nova by a score of 4-3 after extra time, which lasted for an additional 12 minutes following a tie at halftime (2-2). José Aldo from Ituano scored the winner in added time and Gabriel Falcão provided assists to both regular goals. During the match, there were multiple substitutions made by both teams: Vila Nova had five substitutes on field while Ituano used six different players throughout the game including two additional ones during extra time. The referee for this match was Wagner do Nascimento Magalhaes and several yellow cards were issued to each team's players, with one red card given in added time: Richard from Vila Nova and Leozinho from Ituano.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare this text against the data provided.\n\n1. **Score and Extra Time**: The text says the game ended 4-3 after extra time due to a halftime tie (2-2). Looking at the data, the fulltime score is indeed 3-4, but there's no extratime or penalty data. So, the mention of extra time seems incorrect because the status shows \"Match Finished\" with elapsed time 90 and extra 13 minutes, but no extratime scores. The goals were all within regular time.\n\n2. **Winner Goal**: The text states José Aldo scored the winner in added time. However, checking the events, the last goal was by Vinícius Paiva at \"90' +9\" and another at \"90' +12\". There's no goal by José Aldo in extra time; he had a yellow card instead.\n\n3. **Gabriel Falcão Assists**: The text mentions Gabriel Falcão provided assists to both regular goals, but the data shows he assisted two goals (at 6' and 37'), which is correct. However, the phrasing might be misleading because it implies only two assists, while in reality, he did assist twice.\n\n4. **Substitutions**: The text says Vila Nova had five substitutes on field and Ituano used six, including two in extra time. From the data, both teams made substitutions, but I need to count them. Vila Nova had substitutions at 41',50',56',64',71',72'—that's six substitutions. Ituano had substitutions at 46',61',75',81'—four substitutions. So the text is incorrect about the number.\n\n5. **Red Cards**: The text mentions a red card given in added time to Richard and Leozinho. However, checking the events, there are no red cards issued; all cards are yellow. So this part is wrong.\n\n6. **Yellow Cards Count**: The text says several yellow cards were issued but doesn't specify. The data shows multiple yellow cards for both teams, so that's accurate.\n\nPutting it together:\n\n- The extra time and winner in added time are incorrect.\n- José Aldo didn't score the winner; Vinícius Paiva did.\n- Substitutions count is wrong: Vila Nova had six, Ituano four.\n- Red cards were not issued; only yellows.", "annotator_group": 0}

Bevan among others.", "type": 0, "start": 531}], "thinking_trace": "Alright, I need to identify errors in the provided text based on the given data and classify them using the specified categories. Let me go through this step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll read the text carefully to understand what it's stating about the match between Napier City Rovers and Auckland City. The text mentions that the game was part of Round 8 in New Zealand's National Football league, held at Bluewater Stadium on November 17, 2024. It talks about the halftime score being 0-0, no extra time goals, substitutions by both teams, and S. Ukich scoring the winning goal at the 90th minute for Auckland City.\n\nNow, I'll compare each part of the text with the data provided to spot any discrepancies or issues.\n\n1. **League Information**: The data shows that the league is \"National League - National\" in New Zealand. However, the text refers to it as \"New Zealand'se National Football league.\" There's a typo here with an extra apostrophe in \"Zealand'se,\" which should be \"Zealand's.\" This isn't necessarily an error in fact but more of a grammatical mistake.\n\n2. **Halftime and Extra Time Scores**: The text states that both teams had equal scores throughout the first half (0-0) and no goals in extra time. Looking at the data, the halftime score is indeed 0-0 for both home and away teams, and there are no extra time goals as 'extratime' has null values. So this part seems accurate.\n\n3. **Substitutions**: The text mentions that Napier City Rovers had five substitutes at specific times (46', 61', 65' twice, and 78'). Checking the data, I see substitutions for Napier at 46', 65', 65', 77', 86', and 86'. Wait, the text says 78', but in the data, it's 77' and then two more at 86'. So there might be a discrepancy here. The text lists five substitutes with times including 78', which doesn't exactly match the data.\n\nFor Auckland City, the text mentions four substitutions at 61', 65', and others. Looking at the data, Auckland has substitutions at 61', 65' (twice), 78', and 90'. So that's actually five substitutions, not four as stated in the text. This is a clear error because the text undercounts Auckland's substitutions.\n\n4. **Goal Scoring**: The text correctly states that S. Ukich scored at the 90th minute for Auckland City, leading to a 1-0 win. The data confirms this with an event at 90' where S. Ukich scores a goal.\n\n5. **Match Conclusion and Score**: The text accurately reflects the final score of 1-0 in favor of Auckland City as per the data's 'goals' section.\n\n6. **Other Details**: The venue, date, and teams all match between the text and data without issues.\n\nNow, focusing on the substitutions again because that seems to be where the error lies. The text says Napier had substitutes at 46', 61', 65' twice, and 78'. But in reality, according to the data, Napier's substitutions are at 46', 65', 65', 77', 86', and 86'. So the text is missing some substitution times and incorrectly includes 78', which isn't present. However, the main issue is with Auckland City's substitutions being undercounted.\n\nSo, the key error is that the text states Auckland City had four substitutes when they actually had five. This makes the text factually incorrect regarding the number of substitutions for Auckland City.", "annotator_group": 0}

Since it's cancelled, it might be important to note that it wasn't available, but the text doesn't state availability, so maybe no error here.\n\nWait, in Example #3, a similar situation where the device was discontinued led to an annotation because the text mentioned availability. Here, the text doesn't mention availability, just that it's cancelled. So perhaps no issue.\n\nLooking for other possible errors:\n\n- The data under 'Memory' has 'Call records' as empty, but the text doesn't mention call records, so no problem.\n\n- Under 'Sound', Loudspeaker is 'No', which matches the text saying it lacks a loudspeaker? Wait, the text says \"lacks...Bluetooth, and other modern connectivity options\". It doesn't explicitly say no loudspeaker. Hmm, maybe that's an oversight but not necessarily an error unless the data contradicts.\n\nWait, in the data under 'Sound', Loudspeaker is 'No'. The text does mention it lacks a camera, Bluetooth, etc., but doesn't specify about the loudspeaker. So perhaps the text is missing some info, but since the task is to identify errors, not omissions, maybe that's not an error.\n\nWait, no, the user is asking for errors in the text, so if the text says something incorrect or omits something critical, it's an error. But in this case, the text doesn't mention loudspeaker at all, which isn't necessarily wrong unless it claims otherwise.\n\nLooking again: The text states \"lacks a camera, Bluetooth, and other modern connectivity options\". It doesn't say anything about a loudspeaker, so no error there.\n\nAnother point: The data under 'Comms' shows USB as empty, but the text doesn't mention USB, so that's fine.\n\nWait, in the quickSpec, battery size is 650mAh. Text correctly mentions this.\n\nIs there any numerical discrepancy? Let me check:\n\n- Dimensions: Data says 85x45x20mm, text doesn't mention dimensions, so no error.\n\n- Weight: 74g, not mentioned in text, but that's okay unless the text states otherwise.\n\nWait, the text describes it as \"compact\", which is subjective and allowed per hints. So no issue.\n\nAnother point: The data under 'Features' includes Java as 'Yes', which the text doesn't mention. But again, omission isn't an error unless it's contradictory.\n\nSo, after reviewing all aspects, I don't see any clear errors in the text based on the provided data.

The first day will see light rain in the morning and evening, with temperatures ranging from 26 to 29 degrees Celsius.

Throughout the period, winds will be generally light, blowing at speeds of around 1-4 meters per second from varying directions. Temperatures are expected to remain relatively consistent, ranging from 24 to 30 degrees Celsius throughout the five-day period.\"\n\nNow, I'll compare each part with the data provided.\n\nStarting with the first sentence: It mentions a mix of rain and overcast clouds. Looking at the data, every day except Friday has cloud cover of 100%, which is overcast. So that seems accurate.\n\nNext, it says light to moderate rain showers on multiple days. The data shows rain on Monday (1.04 mm), Tuesday (1.27 mm), Wednesday (2.01 mm and 1.75 mm), Thursday (1.69 mm). Friday has no rain mentioned except for the last entry which is overcast but no rain specified. So, the text correctly mentions multiple days with rain.\n\nMoving to the second sentence: The first day (Monday) will have light rain in the morning and evening. Checking the data, Monday has rain at 00:00 (1.04 mm), 06:00 (1.46 mm), and 18:00 (3.07 mm). So, it's correct about multiple times of rain on Monday.\n\nTemperature range mentioned is 26-29°C for the first day. The data shows temps around 26.68°C at 00:00, rising to 29.01°C by 06:00, and back to 25.7°C in the evening. So, the text's temperature range seems accurate.\n\nThird sentence: Wednesday brings moderate rain. Data shows on Wednesday at 00:00, there's moderate rain (2.01 mm), so that's correct.\n\nFourth sentence: Thursday and Friday see a decrease in precipitation with broken clouds and few clouds. Looking at Thursday, data shows some rain (1.69 mm) but also periods of overcast and broken clouds. By Friday, the cloud cover decreases to 23% on Friday morning, which is 'few clouds'. However, the text says \"decrease in precipitation\" but according to data, there's still rain on Thursday (1.69 mm). So, it's misleading because while there's a decrease from Wednesday's moderate rain, Thursday still has significant rain.\n\nFifth sentence: Winds are light at 1-4 m/s. Data shows wind speeds vary between 0.41 m/s to 5.25 m/s on Monday, which is beyond the 1-4 range. So, the text is incorrect in stating that winds are generally light within that specific range.\n\nSixth sentence: Temperatures remain consistent from 24-30°C. The data shows temperatures fluctuating between 24.47°C and 29.5°C, so this range is accurate.\n\nNow, identifying errors:\n\n1. The statement about Thursday and Friday having a decrease in precipitation is misleading because Thursday still has significant rain.\n2.

{"dataset": "d2t-openweather", "split": "dev", "example_idx": 6, "setup_id": "llama3-3", "annotations": [{"reason": "The text mentions 'some periods of partly cloudy skies,' but the data shows minimal cloud cover with only one instance of 3% clouds.", "text": "some periods of partly cloudy skies, but mostly clear conditions are expected.", "type": 2, "start": 492}], "thinking_trace": "Alright, I need to analyze the given text based on the provided data and identify any errors according to the specified classification. Let me go through each part step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the temperature in the data. The lowest temp is 7.34°C and the highest is 24.78°C. The text says nighttime lows dip as low as 7°C, which matches, but it mentions daytime highs up to 24°C, which also aligns with the data. So that part seems accurate.\n\nNext, precipitation. The data shows all entries have 'rain' set to null or not present, indicating no rain. However, the text states \"no precipitation,\" which is correct. Wait, actually, in the data provided, I don't see any 'rain' field with values, so it's correct that there's no precipitation mentioned.\n\nLooking at wind speeds: The data shows a range from 0.68 m/s to 4.45 m/s, and gusts up to 5.23 m/s. The text accurately reflects this by stating winds range from 0.68 to 4.45 m/s with some gusts reaching 5.23 m/s. So that's correct.\n\nPressure in the data varies between 1012 hPa and 1020 hPa, which matches exactly what the text says. No issues there.\n\nCloud cover: The data shows mostly clear skies except for one instance of 3% clouds on Thursday. The text mentions \"partly cloudy skies\" but doesn't specify any significant cloud cover beyond that. Since most days are clear, saying \"mostly clear conditions\" is accurate. However, the mention of \"some periods of partly cloudy skies\" might be misleading because only one time slot has 3% clouds, which is minimal and not really 'partly cloudy.' So this could be a Misleading statement as it implies more cloud cover than actually present.\n\nPutting it all together, the only potential error is the mention of partly cloudy skies when the data shows minimal cloud presence. This falls under annotation_type 2: Misleading.", "annotator_group": 0}
